I also never thought I'd get to be decent at an instrument, due to my lazy demeanor and my consistent ability to learn everything 80% of the way, but by the time of our last show, I felt like I had actually learned enough to where I consider myself a musician. I'm going to miss playing music in a band of talented kids that are all in one place, because outside of somewhere like SoR, its very hard to find that.  Despite regular shows being pretty radical, I'd have to say that I have two favorite moments. First is the very first show I played in house band, the Rock and Roll Marathon (the Cowboy Mouth one). Never in my life prior to house band did I think that I would get the opportunity to play on a stage that big and for that many people. For the second one, I can group together both trips to Wildwood, NJ. Those trips were my first experiences playing music away from home, and it was glorious. There is nothing more American and awesome than playing music on the steps of the LINCOLN MEMORIAL. Then, we got to spend 2 days of pure rock awesomeness at the beach, playing on the boardwalk and meeting cool people. But in reality, my favorite moment was all of it. Every single second I've spent at School of Rock was worth it.","4729":"Dedicated instructors and staff, culture that encourages development, FUN!!!! 😀, kids get a unique experience - love playing in the \"band\" and playing rock songs.

I also never thought I'd get to be decent at an instrument, due to my lazy demeanor and my consistent ability to learn everything 80% of the way, but by the time of our last show, I felt like I had actually learned enough to where I consider myself a musician. I'm going to miss playing music in a band of talented kids that are all in one place, because outside of somewhere like SoR, its very hard to find that.  Despite regular shows being pretty radical, I'd have to say that I have two favorite moments. First is the very first show I played in house band, the Rock and Roll Marathon (the Cowboy Mouth one). Never in my life prior to house band did I think that I would get the opportunity to play on a stage that big and for that many people. For the second one, I can group together both trips to Wildwood, NJ. Those trips were my first experiences playing music away from home, and it was glorious. There is nothing more American and awesome than playing music on the steps of the LINCOLN MEMORIAL. Then, we got to spend 2 days of pure rock awesomeness at the beach, playing on the boardwalk and meeting cool people. But in reality, my favorite moment was all of it. Every single second I've spent at School of Rock was worth it.","Testimonial 1 - Giver":"Chris W.  ~ SoR graduate, Ashburn, VA","Testimonial 2 - Body":"Dedicated instructors and staff, culture that encourages development, FUN!!!! 😀, kids get a unique experience - love playing in the \"band\" and playing rock songs.

I also never thought I'd get to be decent at an instrument, due to my lazy demeanor and my consistent ability to learn everything 80% of the way, but by the time of our last show, I felt like I had actually learned enough to where I consider myself a musician. I'm going to miss playing music in a band of talented kids that are all in one place, because outside of somewhere like SoR, its very hard to find that.  Despite regular shows being pretty radical, I'd have to say that I have two favorite moments. First is the very first show I played in house band, the Rock and Roll Marathon (the Cowboy Mouth one). Never in my life prior to house band did I think that I would get the opportunity to play on a stage that big and for that many people. For the second one, I can group together both trips to Wildwood, NJ. Those trips were my first experiences playing music away from home, and it was glorious. There is nothing more American and awesome than playing music on the steps of the LINCOLN MEMORIAL. Then, we got to spend 2 days of pure rock awesomeness at the beach, playing on the boardwalk and meeting cool people. But in reality, my favorite moment was all of it. Every single second I've spent at School of Rock was worth it.","4729":"When we decided to send our daughter to SOR, we never imagined what a positive impact that one decision would have on her life. She transformed from a shy, quiet kid to a confident, incredible musician, with an active social life and many close friends she considers her second family.

I'm going to miss playing music in a band of talented kids that are all in one place, because outside of somewhere like SoR, its very hard to find that.

Never in my life prior to house band did I think that I would get the opportunity to play on a stage that big and for that many people. For the second one, I can group together both trips to Wildwood, NJ. Those trips were my first experiences playing music away from home, and it was glorious. There is nothing more American and awesome than playing music on the steps of the LINCOLN MEMORIAL. Then, we got to spend 2 days of pure rock awesomeness at the beach, playing on the boardwalk and meeting cool people. But in reality, my favorite moment was all of it.

There’s a very different culture with the kids here [in the US], where they can go to these schools to learn to play the guitar or whatever at the age of nine or 10. And what’s amazing is that they’re playing British rock from my time when Superstar was being recorded next door to Led Zeppelin at the Olympic studio. Whereas nowadays in Britain the kids are sitting at home with their computers and generating songs that way.”\n\nThe live onstage band, in which no one is more than 12 years old, includes a nine-year-old bass player “whose bass is taller than she is”, he tells me. All of this, of course, also strikes an uncanny nerve with another project he has lately become intimately involved in through his charitable Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation: namely, music education in schools.\n\nLloyd Webber has been particularly excited to see how transformative putting music at the centre of the curriculum can be, and has actively funded projects to do just that.\n\n“You cannot help but notice that schools that take music seriously tend to be more academically successful. I saw for myself how Highbury Grove school in north London, which was a sink school, changed when a new headmistress gave every child a free violin at the age of 11, and for the first week they were taught nothing but violin. Seven years later, it was one of the most desirable schools in the area to get your child into; and three years ago, it secured its first Oxford admission. I went to a concert there recently and all the children were listening intently to a Poulenc clarinet sonata. So my foundation is now helping to roll it out to four other schools. We want to be able to show the government what music can do.”","4722":"School of Rock Closed Monday Feb 15th 2016 due to Inclement Weather","4723":null,"4724":"http://goo.gl/forms/TBpSZ7Nj0v","4725":"https://www.thestage.co.uk/features/interviews/2015/big-interview-andrew-lloyd-webber/","4726":null,"4727":"http://columbia.schoolofrock.com/news/free-back-2-school-jam","4728":"I can't tell you how much it means to me to watch my kid up there, doing something he loves with such confidence.

There’s a very different culture with the kids here [in the US], where they can go to these schools to learn to play the guitar or whatever at the age of nine or 10. And what’s amazing is that they’re playing British rock from my time when Superstar was being recorded next door to Led Zeppelin at the Olympic studio. Whereas nowadays in Britain the kids are sitting at home with their computers and generating songs that way.”\n\nThe live onstage band, in which no one is more than 12 years old, includes a nine-year-old bass player “whose bass is taller than she is”, he tells me. All of this, of course, also strikes an uncanny nerve with another project he has lately become intimately involved in through his charitable Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation: namely, music education in schools.\n\nLloyd Webber has been particularly excited to see how transformative putting music at the centre of the curriculum can be, and has actively funded projects to do just that.\n\n“You cannot help but notice that schools that take music seriously tend to be more academically successful. I saw for myself how Highbury Grove school in north London, which was a sink school, changed when a new headmistress gave every child a free violin at the age of 11, and for the first week they were taught nothing but violin. Seven years later, it was one of the most desirable schools in the area to get your child into; and three years ago, it secured its first Oxford admission. I went to a concert there recently and all the children were listening intently to a Poulenc clarinet sonata. So my foundation is now helping to roll it out to four other schools. We want to be able to show the government what music can do.”","News Item 2 - Photo":null,"News Item 2 - Title":"School of Rock the musical with Andrew Lloyd Webber","News Item 2 - Url":"https://www.thestage.co.uk/features/interviews/2015/big-interview-andrew-lloyd-webber/","News Item 3 - Body":"School of Rock Closed Monday Feb 15th 2016 due to Inclement Weather","News Item 3 - Photo":null,"News Item 3 - Title":"School of Rock Closed Monday Feb 15th 2016 due to Inclement Weather","News Item 3 - Url":null,"News Item 4 - Body":null,"News Item 4 - Photo":null,"News Item 4 - Title":"Free Back 2 School Jam","News Item 4 - Url":"http://columbia.schoolofrock.com/news/free-back-2-school-jam","Pages Alias Name":"columbia","Pages Description":"Welcome to School of Rock Columbia, where students learn to rock their worlds.

This spring, come study the music of: The Who, Genesis, David Bowie, Kiss, Alice Cooper, Van Halen, Twisted Sister, T-Rex, Iggy Pop, Rush, Neil Young, The Guess Who, Bryan Adams, The Band, Alanis Morrisette, Tokyo Police Club, Steppenwolf and more.\n\nShow selections are: The Who, Glam Rock, Blame Canada, and Genesis (Grad School only).","4721":"There’s a pragmatic reason for premiering School of Rock on Broadway, and that’s because schools of rock actually exist in the US – and they produce the sort of kids required who can actually perform in the show. “If it ever goes to London, it’s going to be a lot harder to cast. There’s a very different culture with the kids here [in the US], where they can go to these schools to learn to play the guitar or whatever at the age of nine or 10. And what’s amazing is that they’re playing British rock from my time when Superstar was being recorded next door to Led Zeppelin at the Olympic studio. Whereas nowadays in Britain the kids are sitting at home with their computers and generating songs that way.”\n\nThe live onstage band, in which no one is more than 12 years old, includes a nine-year-old bass player “whose bass is taller than she is”, he tells me. All of this, of course, also strikes an uncanny nerve with another project he has lately become intimately involved in through his charitable Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation: namely, music education in schools.\n\nLloyd Webber has been particularly excited to see how transformative putting music at the centre of the curriculum can be, and has actively funded projects to do just that.\n\n“You cannot help but notice that schools that take music seriously tend to be more academically successful. I saw for myself how Highbury Grove school in north London, which was a sink school, changed when a new headmistress gave every child a free violin at the age of 11, and for the first week they were taught nothing but violin. Seven years later, it was one of the most desirable schools in the area to get your child into; and three years ago, it secured its first Oxford admission. I went to a concert there recently and all the children were listening intently to a Poulenc clarinet sonata. So my foundation is now helping to roll it out to four other schools. We want to be able to show the government what music can do.”","4722":"School of Rock Closed Monday Feb 15th 2016 due to Inclement Weather","4724":"http://goo.gl/forms/TBpSZ7Nj0v","4725":"https://www.thestage.co.uk/features/interviews/2015/big-interview-andrew-lloyd-webber/","4727":"http://columbia.schoolofrock.com/news/free-back-2-school-jam","4728":"I can't tell you how much it means to me to watch my kid up there, doing something he loves with such confidence.

My 13 y/o daughter and I saw the sign from Route 3 and out of curiosity we walked in to check it out.  We were met by a friendly staff member named Ian who was eager to answer our questions.  We were hooked at, \"hello\".  Ian provided a detailed description of the programs available at the School of Rock (SOR) in Gambrils and invited us to schedule a trial lesson.  Additionally, he informed us that he would pass our information on to the owner who would contact us regarding our interests.  Within 24 hours, I received a call from a very enthusiastic Kelly Mannix, the owner, who basically said everything that I wanted to hear and offered everything I was looking for in a Performing Arts School.  My daughter, Corrine, attended the next available trial lesson and even though it was half way through the existing performance session, we joined immediately.  Corrine was registered for weekly Performance and Vocal lessons.  Corrine absolutely loves SOR, and the talented staff.  She has also made new friends who share her interests in music, style and performing on stage.  Corrine recently participated in SOR's very first Performance in May 2015, and is currently enrolled in the next Performance scheduled for September.  However, this time not only is she enrolled in Performance and Vocal lessons, after seeing all of the multi-talented kids at the May 2015 Performance, she is now also learning to play the keyboard with no previous experience on keys.  It was truly incredible to see the kids perform in multiple capacities.  In fact, a close friend of Corrine's was a vocalist, drummer and played keyboard during the May 2015 Performance.  She learned it all at SOR with no previous experience, just the interest, desire and support of a caring, competent staff.  Additionally, Corrine is signed up for every week of summer camp offered by SOR.   In summary, SOR ROCKS!, Corrine ROCKS!, And I highly recommend this local business.

Within 24 hours, I received a call from a very enthusiastic Kelly Mannix, the owner, who basically said everything that I wanted to hear and offered everything I was looking for in a Performing Arts School.  My daughter, Corrine, attended the next available trial lesson and even though it was half way through the existing performance session, we joined immediately.  Corrine was registered for weekly Performance and Vocal lessons.  Corrine absolutely loves SOR, and the talented staff.  She has also made new friends who share her interests in music, style and performing on stage.  Corrine recently participated in SOR's very first Performance in May 2015, and is currently enrolled in the next Performance scheduled for September.  However, this time not only is she enrolled in Performance and Vocal lessons, after seeing all of the multi-talented kids at the May 2015 Performance, she is now also learning to play the keyboard with no previous experience on keys.  It was truly incredible to see the kids perform in multiple capacities.  In fact, a close friend of Corrine's was a vocalist, drummer and played keyboard during the May 2015 Performance.  She learned it all at SOR with no previous experience, just the interest, desire and support of a caring, competent staff.  Additionally, Corrine is signed up for every week of summer camp offered by SOR.   In summary, SOR ROCKS!, Corrine ROCKS!, And I highly recommend this local business.

              "description": "Our Music Director (Travis Adams) uses his skills as a multi-instrumentalist and experienced teacher to build our students' musicianship and confidence not only in music, but in their every day lives. He holds degrees in both Entertainment Business and Recording Arts (audio engineering) which he acquired from Full Sail University in Orlando, FL. It is the combination of Travis's education, experience, and endless desire to become a better musician that allows him to bring a high level of energy and attentiveness to his lessons and group activiies. Aside from that, he just simply loves to have FUN and makes sure to apply this in his direction of all programs that School of Rock Vienna has to offer our kids.\r\n\r\nTravis's musical journey started with private piano lessons at the age of 3. By age 9, he had picked up his dad's guitar and started a band with his friends while simultaneously studying percussion with Bill Richards, the Section Leader for The United States Army Band. This helped him to become 1st Chair snare for the Fairfax County District Band in 8th grade, where he opted to play tympani instead. At age 14, Travis spent part of his summer vacation to visit with the Dean of Admissions at Belmont University in Nashville, TN to seek career advice and after a brief experience with marching band competitions in his freshman year of high school, left the more traditional music environment to make time to focus his interest in music business and performing.\r\n\r\nSince then, Travis has performed in countless bands and held positions within independent record labels, booking agencies, and recording studios around the country. He has worked closely in writing, producing, engineering, and performing with multiple artists. Some of these include: BJ Kerwin (The Last Year, Nikki Bar Band), Finver Four, Cat Shell, Mike Mineo, DJ Konfewshus (Hometown Hooligans), Zeke Northstar, American Giant, Binh Ngo (Jinxed At Twelve, The Rememberables, John Wayne Hero) Stefanie Smerkers (The Coppertones), as well as fronting a few of his own projects in more recent years (Subtle Body, Squarewolf, Travels).\r\n\r\nTravis currently teaches guitar, bass, and drums. As Music Director, he is in charge of all group programs, student performances, and student development here at our Vienna studio. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, drop him a line! \r\n\r\nEmail: tadams@schoolofrock.com\r\nPhone: 703-242-2184",

              "description": "Bobby is a multi-instrumentalist, composer and touring musicinan. His current project, The BobbyThompson Project (BobbyT Project) was formed shortly after he finished touring the US with reggae rockers SOJA and See-I. Building a new fase base around the county was a by-product of his being part of 6 to 8 piece bands playing rock shows in front of thousands from California to Vermont. While off the road in January 2010, Bobby started writing new songs from scratch, culminating in his first single 'Good Things That We Have' which was produced by Todd Wright, who also happens to produce Pat McGee, Shane Hines, Toby Lightman, and many other artists in the pop-folk world. The single is Bobby's first excursion into the realm of pop-blues, ala John Mayer and Eric Clapton. It worked, and the song is now a fan favorite. So the songwriting continued and Bobby got together with his band, plus a cast of musical all-stars, like Ron Holloway (Gov't Mule, Dizzie Gillespe, Susan Tedeshi) and Tommy Lepson, and began the sessions that would produce the blues-rock album 'By The Hand'. Released in March 2011 and produced by drummer Gary Crockett, the album represents Bobby's skill with blues, and blues-rock, showcasing both his guitar chops and singing, while never straying from the song. Obvious influences include Ben Harper and Warren Haynes, but you can hear the blues greats, you can hear some Neil Young and Tom Petty and some young Clapton. For Bobby, this is the beginning of his album-making career. His 2nd album is already underway and is a continuation of the sessions for 'Good Things'. Bobby has plans to record an EP with an array of session musicians, to be produced by Todd Wright. Song titles like 'Again', 'I Came To See You', and 'Down To Here' are the first songs to be written in Todd's new studio. He is genuinely excited to be a part of School of Rock and work with our amazing young musicians.",

He has been in several bands (Hot Buttered Elvis, Bloody Meri, SUPERFAMOUS) and has extensive experience both on stage and in the recording studio. He loves all kinds of music, from blues and blues-based styles like rock and jazz, to more esoteric and atmospheric genres. These days he devotes much of his time to writing songs and instrumental music. He lives on the west end of Alexandria Va, inside the DC beltway, with his cat Dolphy.",

              "description": "A multifaceted musician, Kevin has been studying and playing the piano since age 5. The piano has always been his central passion, and although he plays guitar and other string instruments as well, he believes the piano is, of all the instruments, the one most capable of being a full vehicle for musical expression. Needless to say, it is his favorite tool for exploring the musical realm, whether in composition, improvisation, or performing written music. Kevin enjoys all genres of music and received his Bachelor of Arts in Jazz Studies from George Mason University. He studies piano with renowned DC-area jazz pianist Wade Beach. When not teaching at School of Rock or practicing, Kevin can be found performing at various DC Area restaurants, bars, weddings, church functions, and, oh yeah, he sings and teaches voice too. Kevin has a keen interest in singing, and has performed as a soloist with GMU choirs. Along with his interest in jazz, Kevin enthusiastically pursues Irish traditional music, and performs with Irish bands in the Northern Virginia area.",

              "description": "Mike Stetson is a guitarist, singer, songwriter, and music teacher. He was born in Massachusetts and raised in New Hampshire. Mike began playing guitar at age nine and his passion has never ended. While still in high school Mike studied with Vermont jazz guitarist Draa Hobbs, who gavehim a solid foundation in music theory and technique. Although he studied jazz in his lessons, Mike's real passion was for the classic rock 'n' roll of Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, Van Halen, Rush and many others, and Mike spent countless hours dissecting his favorite records, learning the riffs and solos of his favorite players. After high school, Mike attended Boston's Berklee College of Music, where he pursued a degree in guitar performance. After college, he made his living playing and singing in local rock bands and teaching guitar. His firstbig opportunity came when he joined the New Hampshire country-rock band Tracy and Company, a female-fronted band with which Mikeopened shows for some of country music's biggest acts, including the Charlie Daniels Band, Sawyer Brown, and Terri Clark. Tracy and Company also played a wide variety of venues all over New England,everything from clubs and bars to fairs and festivals.When Tracy and Company disbanded, Mike and some of his former band matesjoined Rio Drive, a high energy country-rock band that was an up-and-comingact on the country circuit in its own right, and was also the backup band for Rockabilly Hall-of-Famer Big Al Downing, best known for his hit songs \"Mr. Jones,\" \"Touch Me\" and \"The Story Behind the Story.\" With Rio Drive, and with Big Al, Mike spent five years touring the U.S. and Canada, playing everything from clubs and casinos to some of country music's biggest festivals, sharing stages with such greats as Lorrie Morgan, Ronnie Milsap, Neal McCoy, Confederate Railroad and the Marshall Tucker Band. With Big Al Downing, Rio Drive also played on a number of television shows, and was one of the first bands to play a live concert on XM Satellite Radio. With both Tracy and Company and Rio Drive, Mike not only handled the country 'chicken pickin' ' lead licks, he was also both bands' resident 'rock guy,'Â bringing an edge and a recklessness to each band that set them apart from other acts on their circuit.In the summer of 2005, mentor and friend Big Al Downing passed away and shortly thereafter, Rio Drive parted ways. Mike returned to teaching guitar, teaching both private lessons and group classes tochildren, teens and adults.Mike alsorejoined his old friends in Tracy and Company, playing local weekend shows throughout New England. At one of these shows, Mike met hisnow-wife Kelda. The two were married in 2010, and in 2011, they relocatedfrom New Hampshire to Maryland, where Mike is pursuing new musical endeavors and has begun teaching guitar at the DC School of Rock. Mike and Kelda are now enjoying life in the Washington, D.C. area, along with their three dogs, Bruschi, Molly and Dolce.",

              "description": "A DC native, Ricardo \"P\"-Nut Johnson began his musical journey on the bass in the 5 th  grade when he received his first instrument 'â€œ a Sears electric guitar. He enjoyed the guitar but then he heard the bass in Rufus and Chaka Khan's  Sweet Thing  and from that point on \"P\"-Nut knew he wanted to bea bass player. Hearing of his new obsession, his uncle, a bass player in his own right, loaned him a bass and challenged him to see what he could learn by the time he got back from the road and the rest is history.  During his years in the D.C. area, \"P\"-Nut played with various groups in a variety of styles. He played with the sensational vocal group Prim Degree, the cutting edge gospel group God's Creation, vocalist Gloria Brown and blues great Memphis Gold. In the 90's \"P\"-Nut toured Europe with the blues legend Memphis Gold. After years of playing on stage he decided to go get his music degree and attended the Music Tech College of Music, now called McNalley Smith, in Minneapolis MN. After graduation he stayed in Minnesota for 10 years where was very active in the music scene and where he taught many aspiring musicians. He played with the blues group  The HooDoo Kings , the 12 piece group Arayastone , the reggae mainstay  Dred I Dred , the funk band  Down with Gravity , jazz guitarist John Penny , and a host of others. When you hear him play you get hints of the his influences like Bootsy, Jimi Hendrix, Parliament and Larry Graham to name a few.  \"P\"-Nut is a consummate bass player and works at his craft continuously. In 2007 he attended Victor Wooten and Steve Bailey's Bass at the Beach and later that year he also attended Victor Wooten's Bass Nature Camp. He learned many things at these camps and has integrated them into his playing and teaching. Tired of the cold of Minnesota and homesick for the sights and sounds of D.C. \"P\"-nut moved back in the area in 2011. He has played with a number of groups since being back and is happy to be a part of the School Of Rock family.",

I have participated in two half marathons, multiple 5k's, an eleven miler, a Spartan Race, a Tough Mudder, and the Marine Corps Marathon. Music has guided me throughout my training, and it still guides me through everyday life.

              "description": "Having grown up both in Roanoke, Virginia and Mexico City, Danny Ortiz has had a vast array of experiences playing drums within different contexts. His first musical performances where in gruesome metal shows, thrashing away to a mix of ska and hardcore. From there he spent some time in his native country and learned other percussion instruments and gigged alongside his father and friends with multiple cover bands. During his college years at VCU, Danny and his high school buddies admired the artistic and thriving music scene in Richmond and pursued to form part of it. That's exactly what they did. While studying, and often working part time jobs they performed all over the Richmond City area and surrounding towns in festivals, frat parties, and occasional tours. The last tour Danny partook in covered several states up the east coast and finished in New York City. His band mates and him made friends, had a great time, and performed their hearts out to new and curious listeners. Since that occasion he has relocated to the Northern Virginia area in ardent pursuit of any music related opportunities.",

I also never thought I'd get to be decent at an instrument, due to my lazy demeanor and my consistent ability to learn everything 80% of the way, but by the time of our last show, I felt like I had actually learned enough to where I consider myself a musician. I'm going to miss playing music in a band of talented kids that are all in one place, because outside of somewhere like SoR, its very hard to find that.  Despite regular shows being pretty radical, I'd have to say that I have two favorite moments. First is the very first show I played in house band, the Rock and Roll Marathon (the Cowboy Mouth one). Never in my life prior to house band did I think that I would get the opportunity to play on a stage that big and for that many people. For the second one, I can group together both trips to Wildwood, NJ. Those trips were my first experiences playing music away from home, and it was glorious. There is nothing more American and awesome than playing music on the steps of the LINCOLN MEMORIAL. Then, we got to spend 2 days of pure rock awesomeness at the beach, playing on the boardwalk and meeting cool people. But in reality, my favorite moment was all of it. Every single second I've spent at School of Rock was worth it.",
    "4729": "Dedicated instructors and staff, culture that encourages development, FUN!!!! 😀, kids get a unique experience - love playing in the \"band\" and playing rock songs.

Thanks to everyone at the School of Rock for managing such great programs!!! You truly have enriched our love of music!",

    "Testimonial 1 - Body": "School of Rock has been my second home and the people I've met through it are some of the most important people in my life.  I also never thought I'd get to be decent at an instrument, due to my lazy demeanor and my consistent ability to learn everything 80% of the way, but by the time of our last show, I felt like I had actually learned enough to where I consider myself a musician. I'm going to miss playing music in a band of talented kids that are all in one place, because outside of somewhere like SoR, its very hard to find that.  Despite regular shows being pretty radical, I'd have to say that I have two favorite moments. First is the very first show I played in house band, the Rock and Roll Marathon (the Cowboy Mouth one). Never in my life prior to house band did I think that I would get the opportunity to play on a stage that big and for that many people. For the second one, I can group together both trips to Wildwood, NJ. Those trips were my first experiences playing music away from home, and it was glorious. There is nothing more American and awesome than playing music on the steps of the LINCOLN MEMORIAL. Then, we got to spend 2 days of pure rock awesomeness at the beach, playing on the boardwalk and meeting cool people. But in reality, my favorite moment was all of it. Every single second I've spent at School of Rock was worth it.",

    "Testimonial 2 - Body": "Dedicated instructors and staff, culture that encourages development, FUN!!!! 😀, kids get a unique experience - love playing in the \"band\" and playing rock songs. The program has launched my daughter (one of only a few bass guitar players) into a love of music that is inclusive of many instruments. Thanks to everyone at the School of Rock for managing such great programs!!! You truly have enriched our love of music!",

    "Testimonial 4 - Body": "The performance aspect of the program keeps my son more interested in music than he would be if he only took lessons. It also teaches him to work in a group and get to know and work with other musicians. Also, the program runs very smoothly.",

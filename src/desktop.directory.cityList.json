I also never thought I'd get to be decent at an instrument, due to my lazy demeanor and my consistent ability to learn everything 80% of the way, but by the time of our last show, I felt like I had actually learned enough to where I consider myself a musician. I'm going to miss playing music in a band of talented kids that are all in one place, because outside of somewhere like SoR, its very hard to find that.  Despite regular shows being pretty radical, I'd have to say that I have two favorite moments. First is the very first show I played in house band, the Rock and Roll Marathon (the Cowboy Mouth one). Never in my life prior to house band did I think that I would get the opportunity to play on a stage that big and for that many people. For the second one, I can group together both trips to Wildwood, NJ. Those trips were my first experiences playing music away from home, and it was glorious. There is nothing more American and awesome than playing music on the steps of the LINCOLN MEMORIAL. Then, we got to spend 2 days of pure rock awesomeness at the beach, playing on the boardwalk and meeting cool people. But in reality, my favorite moment was all of it. Every single second I've spent at School of Rock was worth it.",

          "Testimonial 1 - Body": "School of Rock has been my second home and the people I've met through it are some of the most important people in my life.  I also never thought I'd get to be decent at an instrument, due to my lazy demeanor and my consistent ability to learn everything 80% of the way, but by the time of our last show, I felt like I had actually learned enough to where I consider myself a musician. I'm going to miss playing music in a band of talented kids that are all in one place, because outside of somewhere like SoR, its very hard to find that.  Despite regular shows being pretty radical, I'd have to say that I have two favorite moments. First is the very first show I played in house band, the Rock and Roll Marathon (the Cowboy Mouth one). Never in my life prior to house band did I think that I would get the opportunity to play on a stage that big and for that many people. For the second one, I can group together both trips to Wildwood, NJ. Those trips were my first experiences playing music away from home, and it was glorious. There is nothing more American and awesome than playing music on the steps of the LINCOLN MEMORIAL. Then, we got to spend 2 days of pure rock awesomeness at the beach, playing on the boardwalk and meeting cool people. But in reality, my favorite moment was all of it. Every single second I've spent at School of Rock was worth it.",

When we first started he couldn't even play his guitar and now he is soloing Led Zeppelin songs and touring with the House Band.  More importantly, he has gone from a painfully shy teen to a more confident young man.  He literally could not talk to people.  He was painfully shy. School of Rock is life changing.\"",

          "4728": "Several years ago, I was looking for a place for my creative and musical daughter, Kaleigh, to explore her passion. She was already taking piano and voice lessons, but she desperately wanted to work with more contemporary music and with kids her own age.  It was a hot and sunny Sunday, and we were at the Watermelon Festival in Carytown.  We stumbled upon a stage, where teenagers much like my daughter were performing rock songs.  I used my phone to take a picture of the banner on the stage, and the next day I drove from Midlothian to the west end to visit the School of Rock Short Pump. I immediately signed up Kaleigh, even though transporting her back and forth from our home in Midlothian to Short Pump was not exactly practical.  But, it was SO worth it.   The seemingly uneventful hot and humid Sunday trip to the Watermelon Festival turned out to be the greatest benefit to my daughter. Through SOR Kaleigh has learned the important pieces of music education, like how to read music and how to play a variety of instruments including the keyboards, the guitar, the drums and her voice.  And, while I value the traditional approach to music education, she has learned so much more than that through school of rock.  She has learned how to perform on stage, she has learned how to play with a group of people, she has learned how to interact with the audience.  But, like football and baseball, she also enjoys the benefit of being on a \"team sport.\"  SOR and the many iterations of the performance groups are her team sports.  The students, teachers and staff love and support each other, they have developed deep and respectful relationships, and they know,  the success of the group depends on the commitment and participation of each individual member.  SOR bands are Kaleigh's \"team sports.\"\nYet, the most important and valuable part of SOR has nothing to do with music education and team dynamics.  It is through SOR that my daughter developed self confidence and self assurance.  It is through SOR that my daughter made it safely through the angst filled middle school years.   She has learned to be comfortable with herself, and she has learned how to deal with all sorts of personalities.  The confidence and life skills my daughter has gained through SOR  are the most important piece of her SOR experience.\nAnd, luckily enough for us, SOR opened a second location in Midlothian,  and now our rock family is also a neighbor!\n",
          "4729": "\" My mom dragged me to the School of Rock kicking and screaming, I might add.  At this point, I had never sang in front of ANYONE, not even my family.  I had never been on stage nor had I ever entertained the idea.  And then somehow I got \"manipulated\" into doing a Black Sabbath Show. WHO? This isn't Broadway! I learned to embrace their originality and have learned that I can really perservere. Be Dedicated.  Overcome obstacles...This is one of the best decisions I have ever made.\"",
          "4730": " \"School of Rock has developed his social skills, self esteem, his interaction with other kids and his responsibility.  These days he gets home and wants to do his chores and homework.  He was to do it so that he can practice his lyrics and his guitar.  It has been a very positive influence on him.\"",
          "4731": "\"SOR has given our child not only motivational musical training, but the life skills needed to become successful.  He is learning about hard work, patience, responsibility, and the ability to collaborate with others.  I'm sure his future employer will appreciate SOR as much as we do!\"",

          "Testimonial 1 - Body": "Several years ago, I was looking for a place for my creative and musical daughter, Kaleigh, to explore her passion. She was already taking piano and voice lessons, but she desperately wanted to work with more contemporary music and with kids her own age.  It was a hot and sunny Sunday, and we were at the Watermelon Festival in Carytown.  We stumbled upon a stage, where teenagers much like my daughter were performing rock songs.  I used my phone to take a picture of the banner on the stage, and the next day I drove from Midlothian to the west end to visit the School of Rock Short Pump. I immediately signed up Kaleigh, even though transporting her back and forth from our home in Midlothian to Short Pump was not exactly practical.  But, it was SO worth it.   The seemingly uneventful hot and humid Sunday trip to the Watermelon Festival turned out to be the greatest benefit to my daughter. Through SOR Kaleigh has learned the important pieces of music education, like how to read music and how to play a variety of instruments including the keyboards, the guitar, the drums and her voice.  And, while I value the traditional approach to music education, she has learned so much more than that through school of rock.  She has learned how to perform on stage, she has learned how to play with a group of people, she has learned how to interact with the audience.  But, like football and baseball, she also enjoys the benefit of being on a \"team sport.\"  SOR and the many iterations of the performance groups are her team sports.  The students, teachers and staff love and support each other, they have developed deep and respectful relationships, and they know,  the success of the group depends on the commitment and participation of each individual member.  SOR bands are Kaleigh's \"team sports.\"\nYet, the most important and valuable part of SOR has nothing to do with music education and team dynamics.  It is through SOR that my daughter developed self confidence and self assurance.  It is through SOR that my daughter made it safely through the angst filled middle school years.   She has learned to be comfortable with herself, and she has learned how to deal with all sorts of personalities.  The confidence and life skills my daughter has gained through SOR  are the most important piece of her SOR experience.\nAnd, luckily enough for us, SOR opened a second location in Midlothian,  and now our rock family is also a neighbor!\n",

          "Testimonial 2 - Body": "\" My mom dragged me to the School of Rock kicking and screaming, I might add.  At this point, I had never sang in front of ANYONE, not even my family.  I had never been on stage nor had I ever entertained the idea.  And then somehow I got \"manipulated\" into doing a Black Sabbath Show. WHO? This isn't Broadway! I learned to embrace their originality and have learned that I can really perservere. Be Dedicated.  Overcome obstacles...This is one of the best decisions I have ever made.\"",

          "Testimonial 1 - Body": "I can’t tell you what an enriching experience this has been for our whole family and especially for Josh. The instructors there were so much more than teachers for Josh, they were his idols and his role models. It has been an amazing time, and I know that as Josh gets older he will look back on all the memories he made at the SOR fondly. You have created something special there, and I hope you understand what an impact your efforts have had on the lives of these children.Thank you for everything!\n",

          "Testimonial 2 - Body": "The School of Rock in Norfolk is great! The staff there are very kind and helpful. My experience in the SoR Norfolk has been awesome. I highly recommend them for anyone looking for a good musical education. The place is always kept clean, safe, and fun. It is a great environment to play music in!",
          "Testimonial 2 - Giver": "— David S., student from Norfolk School of Rock",
          "Testimonial 3 - Body": "School of Rock is the best thing we have done for our three children. They learn self-confidence, teamwork, and musicianship in an environment that is safe and free of the typical age-barrier restrictions that are often inherent in other student activities. The youngest and oldest kids in the school work together and everyone is an equal on stage. I wish other youth activities were as welcoming. \n",

          "Testimonial 4 - Body": "School of Rock has helped develop my daughter's self confidence. She just lights up when she is on stage. I just love watching and seeing her growth as a person and as a musician. SOR is her second family.\n",

I'm going to miss playing music in a band of talented kids that are all in one place, because outside of somewhere like SoR, its very hard to find that.  Despite regular shows being pretty radical, I'd have to say that I have two favorite moments. First is the very first show I played in house band, the Rock and Roll Marathon (the Cowboy Mouth one). Never in my life prior to house band did I think that I would get the opportunity to play on a stage that big and for that many people. For the second one, I can group together both trips to Wildwood, NJ. Those trips were my first experiences playing music away from home, and it was glorious. There is nothing more American and awesome than playing music on the steps of the LINCOLN MEMORIAL. Then, we got to spend 2 days of pure rock awesomeness at the beach, playing on the boardwalk and meeting cool people. But in reality, my favorite moment was all of it. Every single second I've spent at School of Rock was worth it.",

The program has launched my daughter (one of only a few bass guitar players) into a love of music that is inclusive of many instruments. Thanks to everyone at the School of Rock for managing such great programs!!! You truly have enriched our love of music!",

          "Testimonial 1 - Body": "School of Rock has been my second home and the people I've met through it are some of the most important people in my life.  I also never thought I'd get to be decent at an instrument, due to my lazy demeanor and my consistent ability to learn everything 80% of the way, but by the time of our last show, I felt like I had actually learned enough to where I consider myself a musician. I'm going to miss playing music in a band of talented kids that are all in one place, because outside of somewhere like SoR, its very hard to find that.  Despite regular shows being pretty radical, I'd have to say that I have two favorite moments. First is the very first show I played in house band, the Rock and Roll Marathon (the Cowboy Mouth one). Never in my life prior to house band did I think that I would get the opportunity to play on a stage that big and for that many people. For the second one, I can group together both trips to Wildwood, NJ. Those trips were my first experiences playing music away from home, and it was glorious. There is nothing more American and awesome than playing music on the steps of the LINCOLN MEMORIAL. Then, we got to spend 2 days of pure rock awesomeness at the beach, playing on the boardwalk and meeting cool people. But in reality, my favorite moment was all of it. Every single second I've spent at School of Rock was worth it.",

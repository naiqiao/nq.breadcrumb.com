          "Testimonial 1 - Body": "I can’t tell you what an enriching experience this has been for our whole family and especially for Josh. The instructors there were so much more than teachers for Josh, they were his idols and his role models. It has been an amazing time, and I know that as Josh gets older he will look back on all the memories he made at the SOR fondly. You have created something special there, and I hope you understand what an impact your efforts have had on the lives of these children.Thank you for everything!\n",

They learn self-confidence, teamwork, and musicianship in an environment that is safe and free of the typical age-barrier restrictions that are often inherent in other student activities. The youngest and oldest kids in the school work together and everyone is an equal on stage. I wish other youth activities were as welcoming. \n",

        "description": "Welcome to School of Rock West LA—a haven for aspiring musicians who love rock n’ roll. We believe live performance is the most fun and effective way to teach an instrument, which is why we get kids playing on stage as quickly as possible. Our classes are tailored to all age groups and levels of proficiency, and instructors are passionate about creating a legacy of music by helping students succeed in music and beyond.\n\nWe also believe that music is more than a solo act. That’s why School of Rock West LA teaches kids to play alone and as part of a team. This approach promotes accountability, speeds up the learning process, and fosters an inclusive community of rockers in San Jose. Students are not only learning an instrument—they’re making friends, building confidence, and becoming better people.\n\nWant to know more?

          "4720": "ELMHURST – A child can learn a lot about life by picking up an electric bass and playing a concert alongside other musicians in front of hundreds of people.\n\nAt least that’s the philosophy of School of Rock, 105 N. Maple Ave., a performance-based music instruction organization in Elmhurst that is celebrating four years since it opened for business.\n\n“What I have found is that with this program, music is just the vehicle; it’s not really about the music,” School of Rock Regional Sales and Marketing Manager Joanna Vassilatos said. “What it’s really about here is building the kids’ self esteem, building their confidence and building their social network. Those are the big three pieces.”\n\nVassilatos has been in the music industry for more than 20 years. Before working at School of Rock, she played drums and toured with the all-girl progressive rock band Radio Vago. She also has worked with prolific songwriter Diane Warren and at the Grammy Foundation. But as rewarding as those experiences were, Vassilatos believes they were preparing her for School of Rock.\n\n“I feel like I was led here in a lot of ways,” Vassilatos said. “ I feel like this is more of a calling than anything else. I feel passionate about this because I see the impact it has on kids.”\n\nTo illustrate this point she uses the story of a shy boy who discovered what it was like to be confident.\n\n“The first day he came in, he couldn’t look me in the eye,” Vassilatos said. “In order to have a conversation he would tell his mother and then his mother would relay whatever he said to me. When the kid came in without his mother, he was so shy that while he was waiting for his lesson he would go and read a book while facing a corner.”\n\nAlthough he was there to learn how to play the drums, he wanted to give singing a try, so he was given the chance to sing one song in a concert.\n\n“On the very first show he played – it gives me chills still to think about it – he is singing the song and then at one point drops the mic, gets on the ground, and does the worm in front of 500 people,” Vassilatos said. “The whole place was cheering for him.”\n\nBesides building confidence, School of Rock students develop other kinds of life skills. Because these kids are learning to play instruments in a band, they have to collaborate and work together for the song to sound good.",

          "4730": "In grade school, our son lost interest in hanging out with other kids and doing pretty much anything other than playing video or computer games by himself. Then he started going to the School of Rock, and he discovered music was his passion.  Now that's all he wants to do!

          "News Item 1 - Body": "ELMHURST – A child can learn a lot about life by picking up an electric bass and playing a concert alongside other musicians in front of hundreds of people.\n\nAt least that’s the philosophy of School of Rock, 105 N. Maple Ave., a performance-based music instruction organization in Elmhurst that is celebrating four years since it opened for business.\n\n“What I have found is that with this program, music is just the vehicle; it’s not really about the music,” School of Rock Regional Sales and Marketing Manager Joanna Vassilatos said. “What it’s really about here is building the kids’ self esteem, building their confidence and building their social network. Those are the big three pieces.”\n\nVassilatos has been in the music industry for more than 20 years. Before working at School of Rock, she played drums and toured with the all-girl progressive rock band Radio Vago. She also has worked with prolific songwriter Diane Warren and at the Grammy Foundation. But as rewarding as those experiences were, Vassilatos believes they were preparing her for School of Rock.\n\n“I feel like I was led here in a lot of ways,” Vassilatos said. “ I feel like this is more of a calling than anything else. I feel passionate about this because I see the impact it has on kids.”\n\nTo illustrate this point she uses the story of a shy boy who discovered what it was like to be confident.\n\n“The first day he came in, he couldn’t look me in the eye,” Vassilatos said. “In order to have a conversation he would tell his mother and then his mother would relay whatever he said to me. When the kid came in without his mother, he was so shy that while he was waiting for his lesson he would go and read a book while facing a corner.”\n\nAlthough he was there to learn how to play the drums, he wanted to give singing a try, so he was given the chance to sing one song in a concert.\n\n“On the very first show he played – it gives me chills still to think about it – he is singing the song and then at one point drops the mic, gets on the ground, and does the worm in front of 500 people,” Vassilatos said. “The whole place was cheering for him.”\n\nBesides building confidence, School of Rock students develop other kinds of life skills. Because these kids are learning to play instruments in a band, they have to collaborate and work together for the song to sound good.",

Our boys will come home from school playing, play a concert and are still playing at nearly 10 PM.  It's the teachers there. They are amazing and every bit as passionate about what they do. Worth every penny. Our kids have gained confidence, friends, a talent that had given them more friends (at their age it is not easy to ask kids to play but it's so much easier to ask a group of musically able kids to come jam for a bit), more things to join in school- band, choir etc. Kids who learn music do better academically and have higher test scores (proven over and over) and it keeps them busy with a hobby, teaches them about practicing, not letting your band members (teammates) down. Our kids are more accepting. They now know kids express themselves differently, they aren't dangerous or bad just because they may have colored their hair, etc. We dropped regular piano, drums. It was BORING. They wanted to ROCK! Play songs they were interested in. So we switched and this works! We have been going to SOR for 2 years. Hands down you will not be disappointed. Amazing.",

The youngest and oldest kids in the school work together and everyone is an equal on stage. I wish other youth activities were as welcoming. \n",

This is not a place where the kids dread lessons. Our boys will come home from school playing, play a concert and are still playing at nearly 10 PM.  It's the teachers there. They are amazing and every bit as passionate about what they do. Worth every penny. Our kids have gained confidence, friends, a talent that had given them more friends (at their age it is not easy to ask kids to play but it's so much easier to ask a group of musically able kids to come jam for a bit), more things to join in school- band, choir etc. Kids who learn music do better academically and have higher test scores (proven over and over) and it keeps them busy with a hobby, teaches them about practicing, not letting your band members (teammates) down. Our kids are more accepting. They now know kids express themselves differently, they aren't dangerous or bad just because they may have colored their hair, etc. We dropped regular piano, drums. It was BORING. They wanted to ROCK! Play songs they were interested in. So we switched and this works! We have been going to SOR for 2 years. Hands down you will not be disappointed. Amazing.",

          "4728": "The School of Rock is one of the best kept secrets in the Crofton/Gambrils area.  My 13 y/o daughter and I saw the sign from Route 3 and out of curiosity we walked in to check it out.  We were met by a friendly staff member named Ian who was eager to answer our questions.  We were hooked at, \"hello\".  Ian provided a detailed description of the programs available at the School of Rock (SOR) in Gambrils and invited us to schedule a trial lesson.  Additionally, he informed us that he would pass our information on to the owner who would contact us regarding our interests.  Within 24 hours, I received a call from a very enthusiastic Kelly Mannix, the owner, who basically said everything that I wanted to hear and offered everything I was looking for in a Performing Arts School.  My daughter, Corrine, attended the next available trial lesson and even though it was half way through the existing performance session, we joined immediately.  Corrine was registered for weekly Performance and Vocal lessons.  Corrine absolutely loves SOR, and the talented staff.  She has also made new friends who share her interests in music, style and performing on stage.  Corrine recently participated in SOR's very first Performance in May 2015, and is currently enrolled in the next Performance scheduled for September.  However, this time not only is she enrolled in Performance and Vocal lessons, after seeing all of the multi-talented kids at the May 2015 Performance, she is now also learning to play the keyboard with no previous experience on keys.  It was truly incredible to see the kids perform in multiple capacities.  In fact, a close friend of Corrine's was a vocalist, drummer and played keyboard during the May 2015 Performance.  She learned it all at SOR with no previous experience, just the interest, desire and support of a caring, competent staff.  Additionally, Corrine is signed up for every week of summer camp offered by SOR.   In summary, SOR ROCKS!, Corrine ROCKS!, And I highly recommend this local business.  Come check out SOR and ROCK with us!!!'  \n",
          "4729": "Love this place! My daughter has been in their Rock 101 program for two months. Every week she gets a 30 minute keyboard lesson and an hour and a half group rehearsal. She loves it. We came from a more traditional, classical piano school. She was never excited about going to her lessons. NOW, she looks forward to jamming with her band every week. Her teacher, Charlie, is amazing. He's great with the kids, and really shares his passion for music with them. Every staff member has been so kind, and so responsive! Emails and calls are always returned, and they have even worked with me to switch lesson times. I even love hanging out in the parent's lounge...where I am typing this review and listening to my daughter rehearse right now. :)  Looking forward to my daughter's first performance at Union Jack's in Annapolis!.\n",

          "Testimonial 1 - Body": "The School of Rock is one of the best kept secrets in the Crofton/Gambrils area.  My 13 y/o daughter and I saw the sign from Route 3 and out of curiosity we walked in to check it out.  We were met by a friendly staff member named Ian who was eager to answer our questions.  We were hooked at, \"hello\".  Ian provided a detailed description of the programs available at the School of Rock (SOR) in Gambrils and invited us to schedule a trial lesson.  Additionally, he informed us that he would pass our information on to the owner who would contact us regarding our interests.  Within 24 hours, I received a call from a very enthusiastic Kelly Mannix, the owner, who basically said everything that I wanted to hear and offered everything I was looking for in a Performing Arts School.  My daughter, Corrine, attended the next available trial lesson and even though it was half way through the existing performance session, we joined immediately.  Corrine was registered for weekly Performance and Vocal lessons.  Corrine absolutely loves SOR, and the talented staff.  She has also made new friends who share her interests in music, style and performing on stage.  Corrine recently participated in SOR's very first Performance in May 2015, and is currently enrolled in the next Performance scheduled for September.  However, this time not only is she enrolled in Performance and Vocal lessons, after seeing all of the multi-talented kids at the May 2015 Performance, she is now also learning to play the keyboard with no previous experience on keys.  It was truly incredible to see the kids perform in multiple capacities.  In fact, a close friend of Corrine's was a vocalist, drummer and played keyboard during the May 2015 Performance.  She learned it all at SOR with no previous experience, just the interest, desire and support of a caring, competent staff.  Additionally, Corrine is signed up for every week of summer camp offered by SOR.   In summary, SOR ROCKS!, Corrine ROCKS!, And I highly recommend this local business.  Come check out SOR and ROCK with us!!!'  \n",

          "Testimonial 2 - Body": "Love this place! My daughter has been in their Rock 101 program for two months. Every week she gets a 30 minute keyboard lesson and an hour and a half group rehearsal. She loves it. We came from a more traditional, classical piano school. She was never excited about going to her lessons. NOW, she looks forward to jamming with her band every week. Her teacher, Charlie, is amazing. He's great with the kids, and really shares his passion for music with them. Every staff member has been so kind, and so responsive! Emails and calls are always returned, and they have even worked with me to switch lesson times. I even love hanging out in the parent's lounge...where I am typing this review and listening to my daughter rehearse right now. :)  Looking forward to my daughter's first performance at Union Jack's in Annapolis!.\n",

Christian was rehearsing to perform in the Beatles vs Stones concert on April 30, 2016.  In honor of Christian, a memorial scholarship fund has been set up in his name and all door ticket sales will be donated to the Christian Freels Memorial Scholarship Fund. \n\n Christian was born on December 1, 1999 in Davao City, Philippines and was united with his new family in Rosemount MN on June 4, 2001. \n\nAfter Christian's passing, his mother wrote this on the St Paul School of Rock Facebook Page: \n\n\"To Christian Freels' School of Rock Family,\n\nOur heartfelt thanks for your incredible contribution to Christian's memorial service. On July 11, 2015, Christian followed the sound of your band at PanOProg in Lakeville and there was no turning back. School of Rock meant the world to Christian. We were not even aware of the family bond you shared with him. Your school had become a passion of his in the few months he enjoyed there. \n\nAfter Christian discovered music at your awesome school, his life was truly changed. Even his teachers at school noticed a newfound joy in him. We were overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support from the School of Rock family. Christian loved School of Rock and I thank you for being a passion in his life. Music spoke to Christian and you have spoken to our hearts with your kindness. \n\nWe look forward to the Beatles vs. Rolling Stones concert on April 30. In honor of Christian, Rock on, Beatles!\"\n\nChristian's favorite bands included Green Day and Muse.

A recent Real Estate study called Lowertown the \"hippest zip\" in the U.S. and USA Today referred to Lowertown as \"Hipster Rebirth.\" Since opening in Lowertown, School of Rock St Paul has witnessed the resurgence of the neighborhood and the addition of the St. Paul Saints stadium, kiddy-corner to School of Rock, is the newest addition to the 'hood.

          "4728": "Originally when our son, Robert, joined School of Rock we only thought of it as music instruction.  In the five years that he was a student there, we found out how much more it was!  It was one of the greatest, if not THE greatest, investments we made for his development.  Things he learned there will help him at Hamline University and beyond.\n\nThe first big change we saw was the boost in his self-esteem and self-confidence.  He started in the program during middle school, a period of most people’s life that is somewhere between awkward and awful!  This opportunity gave him the chance to excel in something he could be proud of in that phase of his life.  He has enjoyed meeting new friends that shared his passion and interest in music.  The instructors and staff were ALWAYS encouraging and did a fabulous job of teaching the kids and helping them grow.\n\nIt is a great way for kids to learn teamwork and about the importance of being prepared.  Not only do they learn how to perform in front of live audiences (a skill that most of us never master) but that experience also helps them learn to quickly solve problems when things don’t go as planned.  Additionally it offered our son the opportunity to learn and take on leadership roles in the program as he progressed.  The students are also taught about promoting their events.  These are all excellent life skills that will help in whatever he does in the future.\n\nBeing in School of Rock, Robert was able to also play in the Road Crew group that performs at various festivals and venues around the twin cities.  This past summer he also toured with the Shore Tour group for 10 days and played at SummerFest, Morey’s Pier in Wildwood, NJ, the American Music Festival in Chicago and at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!  The Minnesota kids shared a tour bus with students from Australia, which made it even more amazing for them.  It was truly a life changing opportunity for him!  He has also been able to perform at the International Blues Challenge in Memphis and go on tour with his band in the U.S. and Canada this August.  Additionally, it gave our son opportunities to connect with very successful people in the local music scene as well as some on the national scene.  Now he is enjoying seeing his friends from the program succeed locally, nationally, and internationally!\n",
          "4729": "The variety of programs for kids of all levels, including opportunities for kids who are advanced in their instrument(s). The amazing summer tour opportunities. The mid-season show, combined with Eden Prairie  is a great way to have one big MN-wide event, and then to have the season-end shows be by school.  The caliber of the instructors. The intern opportunities for advanced-level kids. \n\n",

Christian Freels of Rosemount, MN passed away in his sleep March 12, 2016. Christian was rehearsing to perform in the Beatles vs Stones concert on April 30, 2016.  In honor of Christian, a memorial scholarship fund has been set up in his name and all door ticket sales will be donated to the Christian Freels Memorial Scholarship Fund. \n\n Christian was born on December 1, 1999 in Davao City, Philippines and was united with his new family in Rosemount MN on June 4, 2001. \n\nAfter Christian's passing, his mother wrote this on the St Paul School of Rock Facebook Page: \n\n\"To Christian Freels' School of Rock Family,\n\nOur heartfelt thanks for your incredible contribution to Christian's memorial service. On July 11, 2015, Christian followed the sound of your band at PanOProg in Lakeville and there was no turning back. School of Rock meant the world to Christian. We were not even aware of the family bond you shared with him. Your school had become a passion of his in the few months he enjoyed there. \n\nAfter Christian discovered music at your awesome school, his life was truly changed. Even his teachers at school noticed a newfound joy in him. We were overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support from the School of Rock family. Christian loved School of Rock and I thank you for being a passion in his life. Music spoke to Christian and you have spoken to our hearts with your kindness. \n\nWe look forward to the Beatles vs. Rolling Stones concert on April 30. In honor of Christian, Rock on, Beatles!\"\n\nChristian's favorite bands included Green Day and Muse. He played various stringed instruments and the guitar was his favorite.\n\nWe hope you'll join us on April 30, 2016 at 2:00pm at the St Paul School of Rock Beatles vs Rolling Stones concert.  The concert will be at The PourHouse in Minneapolis. Follow the link for more details. \n\n",

          "Testimonial 1 - Body": "Originally when our son, Robert, joined School of Rock we only thought of it as music instruction.  In the five years that he was a student there, we found out how much more it was!  It was one of the greatest, if not THE greatest, investments we made for his development.  Things he learned there will help him at Hamline University and beyond.\n\nThe first big change we saw was the boost in his self-esteem and self-confidence.  He started in the program during middle school, a period of most people’s life that is somewhere between awkward and awful!  This opportunity gave him the chance to excel in something he could be proud of in that phase of his life.  He has enjoyed meeting new friends that shared his passion and interest in music.  The instructors and staff were ALWAYS encouraging and did a fabulous job of teaching the kids and helping them grow.\n\nIt is a great way for kids to learn teamwork and about the importance of being prepared.  Not only do they learn how to perform in front of live audiences (a skill that most of us never master) but that experience also helps them learn to quickly solve problems when things don’t go as planned.  Additionally it offered our son the opportunity to learn and take on leadership roles in the program as he progressed.  The students are also taught about promoting their events.  These are all excellent life skills that will help in whatever he does in the future.\n\nBeing in School of Rock, Robert was able to also play in the Road Crew group that performs at various festivals and venues around the twin cities.  This past summer he also toured with the Shore Tour group for 10 days and played at SummerFest, Morey’s Pier in Wildwood, NJ, the American Music Festival in Chicago and at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!  The Minnesota kids shared a tour bus with students from Australia, which made it even more amazing for them.  It was truly a life changing opportunity for him!  He has also been able to perform at the International Blues Challenge in Memphis and go on tour with his band in the U.S. and Canada this August.  Additionally, it gave our son opportunities to connect with very successful people in the local music scene as well as some on the national scene.  Now he is enjoying seeing his friends from the program succeed locally, nationally, and internationally!\n",

          "4721": "Just like Jack Black students from the hit comedy with the same name, students from School of Rock in Las Vegas are ready to rock.\n\nSchool of Rock Las Vegas West is offering private music lessons with a “twist” for any young musician looking to start their music career in Vegas someday.\n\nRecent rehearsals included Guns N Roses and the Beatles.\n\nThe children who are with a performance group do get to perform at places like the Container Park and the Hard Rock. Additionally, the performers do a fundraising concert to raise money for kids who need scholarships.\n\nArticle link: bit.ly/1K1XyMY",
          "4722": "Paradise resident Teddi Tarnoff didn't grow up jamming on the bass or singing heavy rock, but you wouldn't know the difference listening to her perform today. \n\nAlthough trained in classical music, Tarnoff joined the original School of Rock Philadelphia to learn how to play the guitar at 14. She said the school allowed her to expand her horizons and find her music niche. \n\nLast year, she agreed to run the School of Rock Las Vegas West, 9340 W. Flamingo Road, Suite 117, to help give other students the same opportunity.\n\n“It’s a real music school,” Tarnoff said. “We’re teaching them songs, and they’re learning how to play in a band, but they’re getting as close to a real rock experience as humanly possible.”\n\nThe school offers music lessons and a chance to perform live at local venues for children 7 to 18. The Little Wing program, which was initiated in early March, teaches children 4 to 6 the basics of music theory and rhythm.\n\n“Students come weekly for group lessons and private lessons, depending on their proficiency level,” Tarnoff said. “When they’re ready, they can (enter) into the performance program where they’re cast into bands and shows.”\n\nOnce in the performance program, the children are placed into bands of four or five members. Venue performances are held three times a year and contain about two hours of material.\n\n“They’re on a real rock stage in front of audiences consisting of family, friends and people who happen to just check out the venue,” Tarnoff said. “This season, the kids will perform an arena rock show, so like Journey, Foreigner, Styx and Heart. We will also have a Rolling Stones show, Pink Floyd’s ‘The Wall’ and ’80s prom music.”\n\nAccording to Tarnoff, the children mostly get to decide what show they will perform in; however, the instructors also guide the children to try new styles and genres.\n\n“We really try to challenge them and expand the music that they’re familiar with,” Tarnoff said. “We’re not only teaching them how to play, but we’re teaching them about music and making sure they get a wide berth of styles and sounds to learn from and appreciate.”\n\nStudents who want a bigger challenge can audition for the school’s nationwide AllStars program that gives them the opportunity to tour around the country.\n\n“There are six different groups that go out on the road and play at different festivals like Austin City Limits and Lollapalooza,” Tarnoff said. “They get put on a chartered bus driving from state to state dealing with the trials and tribulations of being on the road. They get the the whole experience.”\n\nSpring Valley resident Natasha Romero-Salas, 15, has loved music since she can remember. She started singing at 4, playing the keyboard at 7 and strumming on the guitar at about 12.\n\n“I used to do a School of Rock type thing before, but it wasn’t as structured,” Romero-Salas said. “Here, I attend lessons Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday. I’ve learned things like what it’s like playing in a group and more about how the (amplifiers) work.”\n\nRomero-Salas, who attends Bishop Gorman High School, 5959 S. Hualapai Way, has performed at the South Point, the House of Blues at Mandalay Bay, Rain Nightclub at the Palms and the Hard Rock Live on the Strip.\n\n“It’s really fun to perform,” Romero-Salas said. “Everything is really organized, and I’ve liked all the venues we’ve performed at.”\n\nAccording to guitar instructor Erik Carlsson, the school serves as a safe environment for children to be themselves.\n\n“They check their baggage at the door and put their social hierarchy on hold,” Carlsson said. “They make friendships that they may not feel comfortable making outside of the (music) school. They let it all go so they can be who they want to be.”\n\nArticle link: bit.ly/1isJGFv",

          "News Item 3 - Body": "Paradise resident Teddi Tarnoff didn't grow up jamming on the bass or singing heavy rock, but you wouldn't know the difference listening to her perform today. \n\nAlthough trained in classical music, Tarnoff joined the original School of Rock Philadelphia to learn how to play the guitar at 14. She said the school allowed her to expand her horizons and find her music niche. \n\nLast year, she agreed to run the School of Rock Las Vegas West, 9340 W. Flamingo Road, Suite 117, to help give other students the same opportunity.\n\n“It’s a real music school,” Tarnoff said. “We’re teaching them songs, and they’re learning how to play in a band, but they’re getting as close to a real rock experience as humanly possible.”\n\nThe school offers music lessons and a chance to perform live at local venues for children 7 to 18. The Little Wing program, which was initiated in early March, teaches children 4 to 6 the basics of music theory and rhythm.\n\n“Students come weekly for group lessons and private lessons, depending on their proficiency level,” Tarnoff said. “When they’re ready, they can (enter) into the performance program where they’re cast into bands and shows.”\n\nOnce in the performance program, the children are placed into bands of four or five members. Venue performances are held three times a year and contain about two hours of material.\n\n“They’re on a real rock stage in front of audiences consisting of family, friends and people who happen to just check out the venue,” Tarnoff said. “This season, the kids will perform an arena rock show, so like Journey, Foreigner, Styx and Heart. We will also have a Rolling Stones show, Pink Floyd’s ‘The Wall’ and ’80s prom music.”\n\nAccording to Tarnoff, the children mostly get to decide what show they will perform in; however, the instructors also guide the children to try new styles and genres.\n\n“We really try to challenge them and expand the music that they’re familiar with,” Tarnoff said. “We’re not only teaching them how to play, but we’re teaching them about music and making sure they get a wide berth of styles and sounds to learn from and appreciate.”\n\nStudents who want a bigger challenge can audition for the school’s nationwide AllStars program that gives them the opportunity to tour around the country.\n\n“There are six different groups that go out on the road and play at different festivals like Austin City Limits and Lollapalooza,” Tarnoff said. “They get put on a chartered bus driving from state to state dealing with the trials and tribulations of being on the road. They get the the whole experience.”\n\nSpring Valley resident Natasha Romero-Salas, 15, has loved music since she can remember. She started singing at 4, playing the keyboard at 7 and strumming on the guitar at about 12.\n\n“I used to do a School of Rock type thing before, but it wasn’t as structured,” Romero-Salas said. “Here, I attend lessons Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday. I’ve learned things like what it’s like playing in a group and more about how the (amplifiers) work.”\n\nRomero-Salas, who attends Bishop Gorman High School, 5959 S. Hualapai Way, has performed at the South Point, the House of Blues at Mandalay Bay, Rain Nightclub at the Palms and the Hard Rock Live on the Strip.\n\n“It’s really fun to perform,” Romero-Salas said. “Everything is really organized, and I’ve liked all the venues we’ve performed at.”\n\nAccording to guitar instructor Erik Carlsson, the school serves as a safe environment for children to be themselves.\n\n“They check their baggage at the door and put their social hierarchy on hold,” Carlsson said. “They make friendships that they may not feel comfortable making outside of the (music) school. They let it all go so they can be who they want to be.”\n\nArticle link: bit.ly/1isJGFv",

        "description": "School of Rock is the leader in performance-based music education. We teach guitar, bass, drums, keyboard and vocals, and our students put on amazing shows at local venues. Our programs, camps and workshops for toddlers, kids, teens and adults make learning to play music fun and create great communities of musicians.\n\nRock 101 is our performance program for kids ages 6-18 who are just starting out on a new instrument. This program includes a weekly private lesson (45 or 30 minutes) and a weekly 90-minute group lesson. The group lesson puts into practice what each student is learning in their private lesson and focuses on the building blocks of performance, playing in a band, and using musical gear. Students work as a band and play through songs ranging from The Beatles and The Rolling Stones to Weezer and The Black Keys.\n\nOnce a student graduates Rock 101 or if they're joining our program already a bit familiar with their instrument, they move into Performance Program! Performance includes a weekly private lesson (45 or 30 minutes) and a 3-hour weekly group rehearsal for the show they're cast into. Rehearsals run 11-13 weeks and each season concludes with each show performing on a real rock stage in the city. Previous venues have included House of Blues, Hard Rock Live and South Point Showroom!\n\nFor our preschool aged students we have Little Wing. Our Little Wing classes were designed alongside leading experts to inspire social and cognitive development while enriching language, literacy and physical development. And above all, Little Wing classes are FUN! Great activities, musical exercises and games set to some of the most important music of our time. Little Wing will foster a love for music that will last a lifetime.\n\nStudents 18+ can enroll in our Adult Program which includes a weekly private lesson tailored to the student's proficiency level and goals. And additionally School of Rock Las Vegas West is equipped with a recording studio! We offer lessons in recording software and practices and have great recording deals and pricing available to students and outside clients alike. \n\nSchool of Rock has something for every aspiring musician. We foster a positive and encouraging environment with an extremely knowledgeable community of students, teachers and parents who all LOVE music and are active in our local music and arts scene! Contact us today to book a free trial lesson and tour, and come find out what School of Rock is all about!",

Prince was a truly original trailblazer in the music industry, mixing all elements of rock, pop, soul, R\u0026B and more into his music. On his first few records, he played more than 25+ instruments just by himself! Not only was he an amazing songwriter himself, but he wrote hit songs for other artists too. This show's playlists will include his hits like \"Let's Go Crazy\" \"Purple Rain\" \"When Doves Cry\" among others as well as songs he wrote for other artists like \"Manic Monday\", \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" and more.\r\nALTERNATIVE NATION\r\nTuesdays from 6pm to 9pm\r\nDirector: Charlie Corletta\r\nStarting Tuesday June 21st, 2016\r\nComing off the age of hair metal, the Seattle scene blew the doors off the music industry in the early 90s. With the release of Nirvana's Nevermind in 1991, the music industry turned its ears away from the Sunset Strip and towards the dreary, cold Northwest. From this vibrant club scene, bands worked out their blend of sweaty, in your face, rock. They called it \"grunge\" or \"alternative\" in the media, even though the rock community hated those terms. This show's playlists include songs from bands like Stone Temple Pilots, Temple of the Dog, Alice in Chains (all pictured here) as well as Nirvana, Soundgarden, Smashing Pumpkins, Garbage, The Cranberries, and more.",
          "4721": "School of Rock is pleased to have Charlie Corletta join their Faculty! Charlie is a professional performance/session drummer. His influences are Buddy Rich, Benny Greb, John Karel, John Bonham. He has studied and learned his discipline of drums and percussion under the professional eyes and ears of Paul Beatie, Bobby Deitch and John Hvasta. First picking up the sticks in elementary schools her he learned the basic fundamentals of percussion in concert band, marching band and district orchestra. Charlie got his professional start playing drums live at the age of 16 when his band opened for the iconic Swedish heavy metal Legends in Flames, this show set the tone for what would be Charlie's dream and passion. Touring and playing countless live shows as both a regional and national act became a constant in Corletta's life. Opening for his favorite bands and performing as a headliner himself, Charlie has experienced so many phenomenal musical and performance moments. Performing in front of crowds as small as fifteen people to as large as ten thousand, no gig has ever been too small or too large for the New York Native. Since and during that time Charlie has recorded drums and released four commercially accepted albums, appeared on numerous singles as session drummer, had regular air play on Sirius XM Liquid Metal as well as FM radio and for a short time stepped away from the drums when he became lead singer for New Jersey based extreme metal act Julius Seizure. Although drums have always been Charlie's main discipline, he is also an accomplished singer, song writer and guitarist. In 2012 Corletta was given the chance to write and publish the theme song \"The Ride Of a Your Life\" for History Chanel's \"We're The Fugawis\" television show. On this song Charlie showcased his ability to write, and perform all instruments when he recorded drums, guitar, bass, and vocals for the song. That talented has also been displayed in Charlie's heavy metal solo project The Silencer, where he writes and performs all material and all instruments on record. When Charlie isn't performing with his bands, teaching, or recording you can usually find him down in Nyack, NY on the Hudson River jamming out on open jam nights with some of the areas most sought after, top Notch'd musicians at Olives, or Casa Del Sol. \"My mission is to give my students not just an education in drums but the insight, intuition, and inspiration they need to be the most confident and comfortable players to ever sit behind a drum set. I want them to know just how fun and life changing the world of drums can be when they have the ability to be the keepers of time and rhythm,\" said Corletta.

Prince was a truly original trailblazer in the music industry, mixing all elements of rock, pop, soul, R\u0026B and more into his music. On his first few records, he played more than 25+ instruments just by himself! Not only was he an amazing songwriter himself, but he wrote hit songs for other artists too. This show's playlists will include his hits like \"Let's Go Crazy\" \"Purple Rain\" \"When Doves Cry\" among others as well as songs he wrote for other artists like \"Manic Monday\", \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" and more.\r\nALTERNATIVE NATION\r\nTuesdays from 6pm to 9pm\r\nDirector: Charlie Corletta\r\nStarting Tuesday June 21st, 2016\r\nComing off the age of hair metal, the Seattle scene blew the doors off the music industry in the early 90s. With the release of Nirvana's Nevermind in 1991, the music industry turned its ears away from the Sunset Strip and towards the dreary, cold Northwest. From this vibrant club scene, bands worked out their blend of sweaty, in your face, rock. They called it \"grunge\" or \"alternative\" in the media, even though the rock community hated those terms. This show's playlists include songs from bands like Stone Temple Pilots, Temple of the Dog, Alice in Chains (all pictured here) as well as Nirvana, Soundgarden, Smashing Pumpkins, Garbage, The Cranberries, and more.",

          "News Item 2 - Body": "School of Rock is pleased to have Charlie Corletta join their Faculty! Charlie is a professional performance/session drummer. His influences are Buddy Rich, Benny Greb, John Karel, John Bonham. He has studied and learned his discipline of drums and percussion under the professional eyes and ears of Paul Beatie, Bobby Deitch and John Hvasta. First picking up the sticks in elementary schools her he learned the basic fundamentals of percussion in concert band, marching band and district orchestra. Charlie got his professional start playing drums live at the age of 16 when his band opened for the iconic Swedish heavy metal Legends in Flames, this show set the tone for what would be Charlie's dream and passion. Touring and playing countless live shows as both a regional and national act became a constant in Corletta's life. Opening for his favorite bands and performing as a headliner himself, Charlie has experienced so many phenomenal musical and performance moments. Performing in front of crowds as small as fifteen people to as large as ten thousand, no gig has ever been too small or too large for the New York Native. Since and during that time Charlie has recorded drums and released four commercially accepted albums, appeared on numerous singles as session drummer, had regular air play on Sirius XM Liquid Metal as well as FM radio and for a short time stepped away from the drums when he became lead singer for New Jersey based extreme metal act Julius Seizure. Although drums have always been Charlie's main discipline, he is also an accomplished singer, song writer and guitarist. In 2012 Corletta was given the chance to write and publish the theme song \"The Ride Of a Your Life\" for History Chanel's \"We're The Fugawis\" television show. On this song Charlie showcased his ability to write, and perform all instruments when he recorded drums, guitar, bass, and vocals for the song. That talented has also been displayed in Charlie's heavy metal solo project The Silencer, where he writes and performs all material and all instruments on record. When Charlie isn't performing with his bands, teaching, or recording you can usually find him down in Nyack, NY on the Hudson River jamming out on open jam nights with some of the areas most sought after, top Notch'd musicians at Olives, or Casa Del Sol. \"My mission is to give my students not just an education in drums but the insight, intuition, and inspiration they need to be the most confident and comfortable players to ever sit behind a drum set. I want them to know just how fun and life changing the world of drums can be when they have the ability to be the keepers of time and rhythm,\" said Corletta. Other qualifications: ASCAP Member Songwriter/Publisher Owner and Operator of independent DIY record label and PR Company Fallen Music Inc. Bachelors Degree in Public Relations/Journalism from SUNY New Paltz",

School of Rock is a brand new school in the 94-year-old Freed Co. building on Central just east of 4th St. '“ next door to the Kimo Theater. Renovation is underway for practice and instruction rooms, rehearsal space, and of course there's a stage that's ready to rock! School of Rock has franchises nationwide and in five other countries and Robert Montoya is about to bring one home to Albuquerque. \"You don't just sit down with a teacher and take a lesson for 45 minutes and then leave,\" Montoya said. \"You are going to work with that teacher and after that you're going to be in a band situation with other kids at your skill and age level.\" \"We've got people who look like rock stars who can say '“ you can do this with your life,\" said Montoya's wife and business partner Dawn Malone. \"You can make this choice, you can be successful, and you can be a great person. It's not just about music, it's about what they do with the rest of their life.\" \"I've always been a frustrated musician,\" Montoya laughed. \"I always wanted to play and that's what I really like about School of Rock. You're in a band situation right away.\" Heads up: School of Rock is a for-profit private school with schedules to fit kids after regular school hours. There is tuition, but it adds up to about the going rate for the same amount of regular private lessons. Target date for the grand opening is Sept. 27.

School of Rock is a brand new school in the 94-year-old Freed Co. building on Central just east of 4th St. '“ next door to the Kimo Theater. Renovation is underway for practice and instruction rooms, rehearsal space, and of course there's a stage that's ready to rock! School of Rock has franchises nationwide and in five other countries and Robert Montoya is about to bring one home to Albuquerque. \"You don't just sit down with a teacher and take a lesson for 45 minutes and then leave,\" Montoya said. \"You are going to work with that teacher and after that you're going to be in a band situation with other kids at your skill and age level.\" \"We've got people who look like rock stars who can say '“ you can do this with your life,\" said Montoya's wife and business partner Dawn Malone. \"You can make this choice, you can be successful, and you can be a great person. It's not just about music, it's about what they do with the rest of their life.\" \"I've always been a frustrated musician,\" Montoya laughed. \"I always wanted to play and that's what I really like about School of Rock. You're in a band situation right away.\" Heads up: School of Rock is a for-profit private school with schedules to fit kids after regular school hours. There is tuition, but it adds up to about the going rate for the same amount of regular private lessons. Target date for the grand opening is Sept. 27.

Strumming a guitar alone in my room seemed worlds away from actually performing in front of anyone, and I had no idea how people could even begin to bridge that gap. But that's exactly what school of rock has allowed me to do. Performing music has been one of the most wonderful and gratifying things I've ever experienced, and I'm so grateful that school of rock is here to give that opportunity to anyone willing to put in the work.

He beams with pride watching his son belt out Aerosmith classics on stage at the School of Rock, Cleveland. “I never even knew such a school existed, except in the movie,” says Jesse. “And there’s one location right here in Highland Heights.” Jesse discovered The School of Rock, Cleveland, while working on the International Motorcycle Show (IMS), which Progressive sponsors. He and his colleague, Marketing Events Specialist Todd Matthews, were brainstorming ideas to energize the show, which features all the major motorcycle manufacturers in the world. They realized rock ‘n’ roll was definitely missing from this event. “We knew we couldn’t afford to pay a rock band to tour with the show, but we wanted to find some way to incorporate that type of energy and excitement” says Jesse. “Todd suggested partnering with the School of Rock since they are the largest after-school music program in the country. With locations in most metro areas, they could bring in local students to perform at each of the 11 IMS shows. They were excited to get that kind of exposure—we provided the stage and they provided the music. It was truly a win/win.”\n\nWatching the budding rock stars perform at the IMS Show inspired Jesse in a more personal way as well. “The kids were amazing,” said Jesse. “And they were having so much fun on that stage. It got me thinking of my own son.” Jesse and his then 9-year-old son, Ryan, were taking guitar lessons together—something Jesse had always wanted to try. “We were doing this father-son thing and really enjoying spending time together,” says Jesse. “But I could see that Ryan’s interest in guitar was starting to wane.” That’s when Jesse had the idea to introduce Ryan to the School of Rock, Cleveland. “At first, I didn’t think he’d be into the performing aspect,” says Jesse. “But at his first group practice, they taught him how to play ‘Seven Nation Army’ by The White Stripes, and from that moment on, he was hooked. Now he can’t wait to get back on stage after a\nperformance!” Ryan started at the School of Rock by playing guitar in the 101 mgroup for beginners, but quickly advanced and now performs on a regular basis.\n\n“Some of his favorite songs to perform on stage have been ‘Rock mand Roll, Hoochie Koo’ by Rick Derringer, which he played at the Battle of Ohio Show,” said Jesse. “He also loved playing ‘Walk This Way’ in the Aerosmith Show and ‘Foxy Lady’ by Jimi Hendrix in the 27 Club Show\"",
          "4722": "This is an article written by Attorney Jon Hyman for the Ohio Employer's Law Blog: Those of you who've been reading for awhile know that my 8-year-old daughter plays in a rock band. 'Band' might be too ambitious of a term. She's taken guitar lessons atSchool of Rock, in Strongsville, Ohio, for a couple of years, and since January has taken part in its performance program, which is known asRock 101for the beginner musicians. For herfirst set of performances in January, she was the only student, leaving her to play guitarandsing on every song. That pattern continued for hernext set of shows in May, as the band added a drummer, but no singers. Norah performed her most recent shows over the past two Saturdays. This time, even though she was joined by two other singers, she still sang lead on three of the songs (while still playing guitar), and added a new instrument, bass, on the fourth.Needless to say, she killed it (again): So you don't think I'mjusta shill for my daughter, here are four talent-management lessons to take away from my rock star: 1. Let employees be who they are.'Cutetallica' was born out of the show director telling Norah that she sounds too cute when she singsFor Whom the Bell Tolls, which, after all, is about death and the Grim Reaper. Her guitar teacher, on the other hand, liked Norah's cute-sounding version of the song. Hence,Cutetallica. Your employees are who they are. If you want their best, don't try to force a round peg into a square hole. Instead, let them perform while being true to themselves and their talents. 2. Push your employees.School of Rock gets it. It knows how to push kids to their limits, and recognizes that, much more often than not, talent rises to the occasion. Let your employees rise and fall to their abilities. Push them hard, and take away the safety net. They'll surprise and delight you. 3. Age has no role in the workplace.Don't rely on age (youngorold) as a factor in your employment or staffing decisions. If School of Rock limited Norah's ceiling by her 8-year-old age, she'd still be playing one instrument, and would stay in Rock 101 for a few more years. Instead, they allow her to take off the training wheels and succeed by her ability, not the perception of her ability based on how many years she's been alive. 4. Talent is not a substitute for hard work.What impresses me most about how well Norah performs isn't the performance, but all of the time and effort she puts in to honing it. Yes, I can be the nagging parent ('Did you practice your guitar today?' ), but she's the one putting in the time in her bedroom, making sure she's going to nail her solo inAbout A Girl, and guaranteeing that she won't forget any lyrics in the second verse ofFor Whom the Bell Tolls. Talent can sometimes leave you in the lurch, but hard work never will. This was Norah's last Rock 101 performance. She's graduated to playing with the older, more experienced kids. Four months from now, I'll be back to entertain you withthe music of Joan Jett, as strummed and sung by Norah Hyman, maybe with an HR or employment law lesson to teach along the way. If you're in the area, Cutetallica has one show left, this Sunday, September 21, at 4 pm, at the Strongsville Chalet, 16200 Valley Pkwy, Strongsville, Ohio, as part of theArts in Strongsville 'Day at the Chalet.'",
          "4723": "We were so pleased to hear that the panel mentioned our Joan Jett group on WVIZ's Sound of Ideas morning show. The Rock Hall Induction ceremonies come rolling back into Cleveland this month, with a strong dose of star power, ranging from the two living Beatles, to Stevie Wonder, Joan Jett and Green Day. The week leading up to the April 18 th celebration will be filled with community events and concerts, that will commemorate the 30 th annual induction, and the 20 th anniversary of the Rock Hall's lakefront building. Cleveland may be the home of the Rock Hall, but how much does Cleveland rock? Can a musician make a living here? Can the city support a music club scene? And how are changes in technology altering the landscape for making and listening to music? We lead off 'Rock Week' with an exploration of how the music business impacts Northeast Ohio.

          "4728": "School of Rock has been an amazing experience for my family. Norah started guitar lessons with Ed when she was only 6, and was up on stage with Rock 101 at age 7. It's been awesome to see her grow as a musician and into a performer, but it's also been awesome to see her develop deep relationships with her teachers (who we see as mentors and she sees as rock-star idols) -- Ed, Kayleigh, and Donald. Our son, age 6, has also now started keyboard lessons, and I can't wait to see him up on stage doing his thing in the future.School of Rock is a special place that brings out the best in its students. It's a safe, caring, \"cool\" environment. We are not \"our kids have to have an activity to do each day\" parents. We'd rather our kids have a interest they can nurture into a talent at which they can excel. I am so happy that we found School of Rock for our family.Added bonus for me -- no Top 40 music in the car. Instead, my daughter requests Ozzy's Boneyard. How can you beat that?",
          "4729": "Our son has been at the School of Rock Strongsville since it opened over 2 years ago.The level at which he plays drums now is AMAZING to say the least. The ONLY way to truly get the School of Rock experience is to see them LIVE. Check out any of their performance programs live at many local clubs ,under the lights, up on stage and you will be convinced.\n",
          "4730": "Thank you!  All of you!  I love being apart of the SoR community!  I would not trade it for anything.  You guys make me happy and loud.  There’s ALWAYS someone there if I’m down, whether it’s a student or an instructor.  You guys make my day each week and I always can’t wait for rehearsals!  I know I’m not a perfect student, but I’m glad people enjoy me there!  I’ve made some of my best friends there and age doesn’t matter (I’m best friends with a 9-year old and I’m proud to admit it!). Some of my best memories have been made there and I can’t wait to make more!  THANKS FOR BEING AMAZING!  My home away from home!  So, to my second family, I love you all!\n",
          "4731": "Just wanted to drop this note about how much School of Rock and the instructors there have meant to us as a family and especially to Scott. Prior to starting with the SoR, he was taking private lessons on guitar. We saw that he had a passion for it, but like many young kids he felt frustrated with the lack of progress he was making. We heard from a friend about SoR and decided to enroll him in one of your Summer Camps. WOW, the difference that \n5 days made. Scott came out of his shell and got the fever. The performance based work the staff does with these kids is phenomenal. I still don't understand how or why this happened, but  SoR has changed him in many ways, all for the best. Even his grades improved. \n\nWatching our son, and the other kids in SoR and the work you and your staff does just amazes me at what you can accomplish with them. The bonds and friendships they have made have even gone outside School of Rock. Keep up the good work. There are lots of kids out there can benefit from this program as much as Scott has. Don't ever let the music die. \n",

          "News Item 2 - Body": "“Turn that racket down!” Many of us heard this from our parents growing up—and many of us are now saying the same thing to our own kids. Not Special Lines\n\nMarketing Manager Jesse McKendry. He beams with pride watching his son belt out Aerosmith classics on stage at the School of Rock, Cleveland. “I never even knew such a school existed, except in the movie,” says Jesse. “And there’s one location right here in Highland Heights.” Jesse discovered The School of Rock, Cleveland, while working on the International Motorcycle Show (IMS), which Progressive sponsors. He and his colleague, Marketing Events Specialist Todd Matthews, were brainstorming ideas to energize the show, which features all the major motorcycle manufacturers in the world. They realized rock ‘n’ roll was definitely missing from this event. “We knew we couldn’t afford to pay a rock band to tour with the show, but we wanted to find some way to incorporate that type of energy and excitement” says Jesse. “Todd suggested partnering with the School of Rock since they are the largest after-school music program in the country. With locations in most metro areas, they could bring in local students to perform at each of the 11 IMS shows. They were excited to get that kind of exposure—we provided the stage and they provided the music. It was truly a win/win.”\n\nWatching the budding rock stars perform at the IMS Show inspired Jesse in a more personal way as well. “The kids were amazing,” said Jesse. “And they were having so much fun on that stage. It got me thinking of my own son.” Jesse and his then 9-year-old son, Ryan, were taking guitar lessons together—something Jesse had always wanted to try. “We were doing this father-son thing and really enjoying spending time together,” says Jesse. “But I could see that Ryan’s interest in guitar was starting to wane.” That’s when Jesse had the idea to introduce Ryan to the School of Rock, Cleveland. “At first, I didn’t think he’d be into the performing aspect,” says Jesse. “But at his first group practice, they taught him how to play ‘Seven Nation Army’ by The White Stripes, and from that moment on, he was hooked. Now he can’t wait to get back on stage after a\nperformance!” Ryan started at the School of Rock by playing guitar in the 101 mgroup for beginners, but quickly advanced and now performs on a regular basis.\n\n“Some of his favorite songs to perform on stage have been ‘Rock mand Roll, Hoochie Koo’ by Rick Derringer, which he played at the Battle of Ohio Show,” said Jesse. “He also loved playing ‘Walk This Way’ in the Aerosmith Show and ‘Foxy Lady’ by Jimi Hendrix in the 27 Club Show\"",

          "News Item 3 - Body": "This is an article written by Attorney Jon Hyman for the Ohio Employer's Law Blog: Those of you who've been reading for awhile know that my 8-year-old daughter plays in a rock band. 'Band' might be too ambitious of a term. She's taken guitar lessons atSchool of Rock, in Strongsville, Ohio, for a couple of years, and since January has taken part in its performance program, which is known asRock 101for the beginner musicians. For herfirst set of performances in January, she was the only student, leaving her to play guitarandsing on every song. That pattern continued for hernext set of shows in May, as the band added a drummer, but no singers. Norah performed her most recent shows over the past two Saturdays. This time, even though she was joined by two other singers, she still sang lead on three of the songs (while still playing guitar), and added a new instrument, bass, on the fourth.Needless to say, she killed it (again): So you don't think I'mjusta shill for my daughter, here are four talent-management lessons to take away from my rock star: 1. Let employees be who they are.'Cutetallica' was born out of the show director telling Norah that she sounds too cute when she singsFor Whom the Bell Tolls, which, after all, is about death and the Grim Reaper. Her guitar teacher, on the other hand, liked Norah's cute-sounding version of the song. Hence,Cutetallica. Your employees are who they are. If you want their best, don't try to force a round peg into a square hole. Instead, let them perform while being true to themselves and their talents. 2. Push your employees.School of Rock gets it. It knows how to push kids to their limits, and recognizes that, much more often than not, talent rises to the occasion. Let your employees rise and fall to their abilities. Push them hard, and take away the safety net. They'll surprise and delight you. 3. Age has no role in the workplace.Don't rely on age (youngorold) as a factor in your employment or staffing decisions. If School of Rock limited Norah's ceiling by her 8-year-old age, she'd still be playing one instrument, and would stay in Rock 101 for a few more years. Instead, they allow her to take off the training wheels and succeed by her ability, not the perception of her ability based on how many years she's been alive. 4. Talent is not a substitute for hard work.What impresses me most about how well Norah performs isn't the performance, but all of the time and effort she puts in to honing it. Yes, I can be the nagging parent ('Did you practice your guitar today?' ), but she's the one putting in the time in her bedroom, making sure she's going to nail her solo inAbout A Girl, and guaranteeing that she won't forget any lyrics in the second verse ofFor Whom the Bell Tolls. Talent can sometimes leave you in the lurch, but hard work never will. This was Norah's last Rock 101 performance. She's graduated to playing with the older, more experienced kids. Four months from now, I'll be back to entertain you withthe music of Joan Jett, as strummed and sung by Norah Hyman, maybe with an HR or employment law lesson to teach along the way. If you're in the area, Cutetallica has one show left, this Sunday, September 21, at 4 pm, at the Strongsville Chalet, 16200 Valley Pkwy, Strongsville, Ohio, as part of theArts in Strongsville 'Day at the Chalet.'",

The week leading up to the April 18 th celebration will be filled with community events and concerts, that will commemorate the 30 th annual induction, and the 20 th anniversary of the Rock Hall's lakefront building.

It's been awesome to see her grow as a musician and into a performer, but it's also been awesome to see her develop deep relationships with her teachers (who we see as mentors and she sees as rock-star idols) -- Ed, Kayleigh, and Donald. Our son, age 6, has also now started keyboard lessons, and I can't wait to see him up on stage doing his thing in the future.School of Rock is a special place that brings out the best in its students. It's a safe, caring, \"cool\" environment. We are not \"our kids have to have an activity to do each day\" parents. We'd rather our kids have a interest they can nurture into a talent at which they can excel. I am so happy that we found School of Rock for our family.Added bonus for me -- no Top 40 music in the car. Instead, my daughter requests Ozzy's Boneyard. How can you beat that?",

          "Testimonial 4 - Body": "Just wanted to drop this note about how much School of Rock and the instructors there have meant to us as a family and especially to Scott. Prior to starting with the SoR, he was taking private lessons on guitar. We saw that he had a passion for it, but like many young kids he felt frustrated with the lack of progress he was making. We heard from a friend about SoR and decided to enroll him in one of your Summer Camps. WOW, the difference that \n5 days made. Scott came out of his shell and got the fever. The performance based work the staff does with these kids is phenomenal. I still don't understand how or why this happened, but  SoR has changed him in many ways, all for the best. Even his grades improved. \n\nWatching our son, and the other kids in SoR and the work you and your staff does just amazes me at what you can accomplish with them. The bonds and friendships they have made have even gone outside School of Rock. Keep up the good work. There are lots of kids out there can benefit from this program as much as Scott has. Don't ever let the music die. \n",

Children from Lake Oswego School of Rock, Seattle, New York, Los Angeles, Bogata, Kingston and Nine Miles, Jamaica sing and play all of the instruments parts on this ground breaking collaboration. The rich musical legacy of Bob Marley transcends age and time. The Reggae music legend would have been 70 this year. We pay tribute to Bob with this collection of songs, performed by some of his youngest fans. This ten-track collection was performed entirely by Aaron Nigel Smith's 1World Chorus '“ a collaboration of children 7 to 15 years of age, from Kenya, Colombia, the United States and Jamaica. Judah Marley, granddaughter of the late reggae icon, also makes a guest vocal appearance on 'Bend Down Low'. These budding musicians performed everything from the first drumbeat to the last vocal take, tracking the album over 18 months in studios around the world. During the production process, the children strengthened their own musicianship and learned basic recording techniques. Bob Marley had an affinity for sharing music with children '“ teaching his own, guiding them to form Ziggy Marley Melody Maker's, and penning their first song 'Children Playing In The Streets'. Marley's love for sharing music with children also shines through in the timeless 'Is This Love' video. 'Celebrate Bob Marley' reinforces how deep Marley's musical imprint and message of 'One Love' continues to reach, resonating with kids of all ages. In addition to providing free music workshops to schools participating in this special project, a portion of sales will benefit these music programs. Further, 1World Chorus has partnered with some of the nation's leading companies to provide on-going support to the project. Remo Drums, Martin Guitars and Guitar Center have all donated musical instructions to the schools, with Keen Footwear donating socks and shoes to the students.",

The level of music education they've received is impressive, and the performance opportunities are unlike anything provided by any other music school, both of which make the School of Rock in Lake Oswego a unique and wonderful place. What's more, though, is the sense of community that the school provides -- the kids feel supported by the warm atmosphere created by the teachers and staff, and are motivated to come together as a band with the other kids to put on a great show each season. The result is that my kids love to practice their instruments, get excited about lessons and rehearsals, and feel like they have found a place where they truly belong. I can't recommend the School of Rock highly enough!",

Children from Lake Oswego School of Rock, Seattle, New York, Los Angeles, Bogata, Kingston and Nine Miles, Jamaica sing and play all of the instruments parts on this ground breaking collaboration. The rich musical legacy of Bob Marley transcends age and time. The Reggae music legend would have been 70 this year. We pay tribute to Bob with this collection of songs, performed by some of his youngest fans. This ten-track collection was performed entirely by Aaron Nigel Smith's 1World Chorus '“ a collaboration of children 7 to 15 years of age, from Kenya, Colombia, the United States and Jamaica. Judah Marley, granddaughter of the late reggae icon, also makes a guest vocal appearance on 'Bend Down Low'. These budding musicians performed everything from the first drumbeat to the last vocal take, tracking the album over 18 months in studios around the world. During the production process, the children strengthened their own musicianship and learned basic recording techniques. Bob Marley had an affinity for sharing music with children '“ teaching his own, guiding them to form Ziggy Marley Melody Maker's, and penning their first song 'Children Playing In The Streets'. Marley's love for sharing music with children also shines through in the timeless 'Is This Love' video. 'Celebrate Bob Marley' reinforces how deep Marley's musical imprint and message of 'One Love' continues to reach, resonating with kids of all ages. In addition to providing free music workshops to schools participating in this special project, a portion of sales will benefit these music programs. Further, 1World Chorus has partnered with some of the nation's leading companies to provide on-going support to the project. Remo Drums, Martin Guitars and Guitar Center have all donated musical instructions to the schools, with Keen Footwear donating socks and shoes to the students.",

The level of music education they've received is impressive, and the performance opportunities are unlike anything provided by any other music school, both of which make the School of Rock in Lake Oswego a unique and wonderful place. What's more, though, is the sense of community that the school provides -- the kids feel supported by the warm atmosphere created by the teachers and staff, and are motivated to come together as a band with the other kids to put on a great show each season. The result is that my kids love to practice their instruments, get excited about lessons and rehearsals, and feel like they have found a place where they truly belong.

          "4720": "By Kristy Locklin Wednesday, Aug. 6, 2014, 9:00p.m. When School of Rock-Wexford opened last September, organizers didn't cut a ceremonial ribbon, they smashed a guitar. Since the obliteration of that six-string, 63 students have enrolled in the program, which began in Philadelphia in 1998 and now has more than 130 locations worldwide. Another franchise is slated to open in Castle Shannon by the end of the year. Attendees '” ranging in age from 2 to 17 '” get to experiment with guitar, bass, drums, keyboard and vocals until they find their musical niche. One-on-one instruction and weekly group rehearsals prepare them for the spotlight. To showcase what they've learned, students will be playing a free concert on Aug. 14, at 7 p.m., in Cranberry Township Community Park. 'When they come in we ask them what their favorite band or song is and go from there,' said General Manager Alicia Pascazi, 23, who has been playing the drums since she was 9. For years, Haley Zaleski, of Franklin Park, took violin lessons. These days she shreds on an electric guitar in venues such as The Rex Theater and Jergel's Rhythm Grille. 'I like (School of Rock) because it gives me the opportunity to play in shows and play more diverse kinds of music,' said Zaleski, 16, who will perform in an upcoming performance at the Hard Rock CafÃ©. The gig is a two-hour tribute to the bands that dominated music festivals such as Coachella and Bonnaroo in the 2000s. Past performances have focused on everything from '80s arena rock to the British Invasion. Keyboardist Zach Muci, 10, of McCandless, wasn't familiar with any of the acts on the current set list '” his dad, a guitar player, raised him on heavy metal '” but now he's taking an interest in electronic dance music called dubstep. 'I'm a very musical guy and I like to learn different instruments,' he said. Muci also serves as percussionist on a few tracks. This rotation of talent gives students a chance to flaunt their skills and strengthen their weaknesses. Alex Robertson, 25, one of seven instructors at School of Rock, said he selects students for each number much like a director casts actors in a musical theater production. A song that boasts a highly technical drum beat might have a more straightforward guitar part, giving students of varying skill levels a chance to rock out. The result, he said, is that they all get better. Manuel Bautista, 14, picked up a guitar when he was in third grade, but he's only been on stage twice. During his debut performance, he admits that nervousness caused him to play too fast. Under the tutelage of Chip Homer, he's learning how to relax and bask in the glory of an on-stage solo. Homer, 29, of Ross, is a drum and guitar instructor. He grew up in a musical family and credits his parents for nurturing his talent, even at the expense of their eardrums. 'Living with a bad drummer is not an easy thing,' he said with a laugh. 'The first step to being good at something is to be bad at something.' When students first start jamming together, mistakes are made. 'But then they start to get good really fast,' Homer said. 'By the end of the semester we have a bunch of really great musicians.' Kristy Locklin is a freelance writer for Trib Total Media.

Since the obliteration of that six-string, 63 students have enrolled in the program, which began in Philadelphia in 1998 and now has more than 130 locations worldwide. Another franchise is slated to open in Castle Shannon by the end of the year. Attendees '” ranging in age from 2 to 17 '” get to experiment with guitar, bass, drums, keyboard and vocals until they find their musical niche. One-on-one instruction and weekly group rehearsals prepare them for the spotlight. To showcase what they've learned, students will be playing a free concert on Aug. 14, at 7 p.m., in Cranberry Township Community Park. 'When they come in we ask them what their favorite band or song is and go from there,' said General Manager Alicia Pascazi, 23, who has been playing the drums since she was 9. For years, Haley Zaleski, of Franklin Park, took violin lessons. These days she shreds on an electric guitar in venues such as The Rex Theater and Jergel's Rhythm Grille. 'I like (School of Rock) because it gives me the opportunity to play in shows and play more diverse kinds of music,' said Zaleski, 16, who will perform in an upcoming performance at the Hard Rock CafÃ©. The gig is a two-hour tribute to the bands that dominated music festivals such as Coachella and Bonnaroo in the 2000s. Past performances have focused on everything from '80s arena rock to the British Invasion. Keyboardist Zach Muci, 10, of McCandless, wasn't familiar with any of the acts on the current set list '” his dad, a guitar player, raised him on heavy metal '” but now he's taking an interest in electronic dance music called dubstep. 'I'm a very musical guy and I like to learn different instruments,' he said. Muci also serves as percussionist on a few tracks. This rotation of talent gives students a chance to flaunt their skills and strengthen their weaknesses. Alex Robertson, 25, one of seven instructors at School of Rock, said he selects students for each number much like a director casts actors in a musical theater production. A song that boasts a highly technical drum beat might have a more straightforward guitar part, giving students of varying skill levels a chance to rock out. The result, he said, is that they all get better. Manuel Bautista, 14, picked up a guitar when he was in third grade, but he's only been on stage twice. During his debut performance, he admits that nervousness caused him to play too fast. Under the tutelage of Chip Homer, he's learning how to relax and bask in the glory of an on-stage solo. Homer, 29, of Ross, is a drum and guitar instructor. He grew up in a musical family and credits his parents for nurturing his talent, even at the expense of their eardrums. 'Living with a bad drummer is not an easy thing,' he said with a laugh. 'The first step to being good at something is to be bad at something.' When students first start jamming together, mistakes are made. 'But then they start to get good really fast,' Homer said. 'By the end of the semester we have a bunch of really great musicians.' Kristy Locklin is a freelance writer for Trib Total Media.

This friends, is the Future of Rock.Then The Performance Group took the stage and an electric Buzz flashed through the room.By the time they ripped through a slammin' version of Cream's White Room the crowd was on their feet.Then the House band cranked it up another notch for rough, Raw Powerful takes on Do You Know Your Enemy and Killing in the Name Of , that have been playing in the fan's heads ever since.Thanks to all the Students for their hard work and dedication. You've come a long way in a short time.Thanks to all the instructors and Staff who helped get them there ..with a special thanks to Julie, Ashlie and Jeremy for pulling together the details to make it come off without a major SNAFU. And Thanks to Rick Morris, (Austin's dad) Roadie Extraordinaire!!But most of all, thanks to the parents and families for supporting these kids on their Musical Journey.This is a great first step on a Journey these students can follow for the rest of their lives.Now... It's on to our Next Season.We have 2 shows planned, and kids can sign up for the one of their choice or sign up for both (see Ashlie for details). ",

I also never thought I'd get to be decent at an instrument, due to my lazy demeanor and my consistent ability to learn everything 80% of the way, but by the time of our last show, I felt like I had actually learned enough to where I consider myself a musician. I'm going to miss playing music in a band of talented kids that are all in one place, because outside of somewhere like SoR, its very hard to find that.  Despite regular shows being pretty radical, I'd have to say that I have two favorite moments. First is the very first show I played in house band, the Rock and Roll Marathon (the Cowboy Mouth one). Never in my life prior to house band did I think that I would get the opportunity to play on a stage that big and for that many people. For the second one, I can group together both trips to Wildwood, NJ. Those trips were my first experiences playing music away from home, and it was glorious. There is nothing more American and awesome than playing music on the steps of the LINCOLN MEMORIAL. Then, we got to spend 2 days of pure rock awesomeness at the beach, playing on the boardwalk and meeting cool people. But in reality, my favorite moment was all of it. Every single second I've spent at School of Rock was worth it.",

          "Testimonial 1 - Body": "School of Rock has been my second home and the people I've met through it are some of the most important people in my life.  I also never thought I'd get to be decent at an instrument, due to my lazy demeanor and my consistent ability to learn everything 80% of the way, but by the time of our last show, I felt like I had actually learned enough to where I consider myself a musician. I'm going to miss playing music in a band of talented kids that are all in one place, because outside of somewhere like SoR, its very hard to find that.  Despite regular shows being pretty radical, I'd have to say that I have two favorite moments. First is the very first show I played in house band, the Rock and Roll Marathon (the Cowboy Mouth one). Never in my life prior to house band did I think that I would get the opportunity to play on a stage that big and for that many people. For the second one, I can group together both trips to Wildwood, NJ. Those trips were my first experiences playing music away from home, and it was glorious. There is nothing more American and awesome than playing music on the steps of the LINCOLN MEMORIAL. Then, we got to spend 2 days of pure rock awesomeness at the beach, playing on the boardwalk and meeting cool people. But in reality, my favorite moment was all of it. Every single second I've spent at School of Rock was worth it.",

          "Testimonial 1 - Body": "I can’t tell you what an enriching experience this has been for our whole family and especially for Josh. The instructors there were so much more than teachers for Josh, they were his idols and his role models. It has been an amazing time, and I know that as Josh gets older he will look back on all the memories he made at the SOR fondly. You have created something special there, and I hope you understand what an impact your efforts have had on the lives of these children.Thank you for everything!\n",

They learn self-confidence, teamwork, and musicianship in an environment that is safe and free of the typical age-barrier restrictions that are often inherent in other student activities.

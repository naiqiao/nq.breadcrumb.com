I also never thought I'd get to be decent at an instrument, due to my lazy demeanor and my consistent ability to learn everything 80% of the way, but by the time of our last show, I felt like I had actually learned enough to where I consider myself a musician. I'm going to miss playing music in a band of talented kids that are all in one place, because outside of somewhere like SoR, its very hard to find that.  Despite regular shows being pretty radical, I'd have to say that I have two favorite moments. First is the very first show I played in house band, the Rock and Roll Marathon (the Cowboy Mouth one). Never in my life prior to house band did I think that I would get the opportunity to play on a stage that big and for that many people. For the second one, I can group together both trips to Wildwood, NJ. Those trips were my first experiences playing music away from home, and it was glorious. There is nothing more American and awesome than playing music on the steps of the LINCOLN MEMORIAL. Then, we got to spend 2 days of pure rock awesomeness at the beach, playing on the boardwalk and meeting cool people. But in reality, my favorite moment was all of it. Every single second I've spent at School of Rock was worth it.",

          "Testimonial 1 - Body": "School of Rock has been my second home and the people I've met through it are some of the most important people in my life.  I also never thought I'd get to be decent at an instrument, due to my lazy demeanor and my consistent ability to learn everything 80% of the way, but by the time of our last show, I felt like I had actually learned enough to where I consider myself a musician. I'm going to miss playing music in a band of talented kids that are all in one place, because outside of somewhere like SoR, its very hard to find that.  Despite regular shows being pretty radical, I'd have to say that I have two favorite moments. First is the very first show I played in house band, the Rock and Roll Marathon (the Cowboy Mouth one). Never in my life prior to house band did I think that I would get the opportunity to play on a stage that big and for that many people. For the second one, I can group together both trips to Wildwood, NJ. Those trips were my first experiences playing music away from home, and it was glorious. There is nothing more American and awesome than playing music on the steps of the LINCOLN MEMORIAL. Then, we got to spend 2 days of pure rock awesomeness at the beach, playing on the boardwalk and meeting cool people. But in reality, my favorite moment was all of it. Every single second I've spent at School of Rock was worth it.",
